My Boy - Elvis Presley

You're sleeping, son
, I know, but, really, this can't wait
I wanted to explain before it gets too late
For your mother and me, love has finally died
This is no happy home, but God knows how I've tried

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

I know it's hard to understand, why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now, each acting out a part
I have laughed, I have cried
, I have lost every game
Taken all I can take, but I'll stay here just the same

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

Sleep on, you haven't heard a word, perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams? Why put you through the Hell?
Life is no fairytale, as one day you will know

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy
Yeah, because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy
Oh, because you're all I have, my boy
