I Don't Live Here Anymore - The War On Drugs

I was lying in my bed
A creature void of form
Been so afraid of everything
I need a chance to be reborn
I never wanted anything
That someone had to give
I don't live here anymore
I went along in will

When I think about the old days, babe
You're always on my mind
I know it ain't like I remember
I guess my memories run wild
Like when we went to see Bob Dylan
We danced to "Desolation Row
"
But I don't live here anymore
But I got no place to go

Beating like a heart
I'm gonna walk through every doorway, I can't stop
I need some time, I need control, I need your love
I wanna find out everything I need to know
I'm gonna say everything that there is to say
Although you've taken everything I need away
I'm gonna make it to the place I need to go

Time surrounds me like an ocean
My memories like waves
Is life just dying in slow motion?
I'm getting stronger every day
I never took our love for granted
You never left me wanting more
But you'd never recognize me, babe
I don't live here anymore

Beating like a heart
I'm gonna walk through every doorway, I can't stop
I need some time, I need control, I need your love
I wanna find out everything I need to know
I'm gonna say everything that I need to say
Although you've taken everything I need away
I'm gonna take you to the place I need to go
We're all just walkin' through this darkness on our own
Beating like a heart
I'm gonna walk through every doorway, I can't stop
I need some time, I need control, I need your love
I wanna find out everything I need to know
I'm gonna say everything that I need to say
Although you've taken everything I need away
I'm gonna take you to the place I need to go

We're all just walkin' through this darkness on our own
We're all just walkin' through this darkness on our own
We're all just walkin' through this darkness on our own
We're all just walkin' through this darkness on our own
