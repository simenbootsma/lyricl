Edge Of Seventeen - Stevie Nicks

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
Said to my friend, baby (Everything stops)
Nothin' else mattered
He was no more (He was no more)
Than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken-hearted
Somethin' within him
But the moment that I first laid eyes on him
All alone on the edge of seventeen

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'

Well, I went today
Maybe I will go again tomorrow
Yeah, yeah
Well, the music there
Well, it was hauntingly familiar
When I see you doin'
What I try to do for me
With the words of a poet
And a voice from a choir
And a melody
And nothin' else mattered

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Said, ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes color
But the sea does not change
So with the slow graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age-old desire to please

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh

Well, then suddenly
There was no one left standin' in the hall
Yeah, yeah
In a flood of tears
That no one really ever heard fall at all
When I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
And not to find an answer, just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singin'
, come away (Come away, come away)

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song (Just like the white-winged dove)
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'

Well, I hear you (Well, I hear you)
In the morning (In the morning)
And I hear you (And I hear you)
At nightfall (At nightfall)
Sometimes to be near you
Is to be unable to hear you
, my love
I'm a few years older than you, my love (I'm a few years older than you)

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song (Just like the white-winged dove)
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song
It sounds like she's singin'
Ooh, baby, ooh, said, ooh
