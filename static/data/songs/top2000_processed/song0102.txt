Bitter Sweet Symphony  - The Verve

'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony that's life
Trying to make ends meet,
you're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet, yeah

No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould
I am here in my mould
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Have you ever been down?)

Well I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

No change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould
I am here in my mould
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?

'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, that's life
Trying to make ends meet
Trying to find some money, then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet, yeah

You know I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mould
I am here in my mould
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no
You've gotta change my mould, no, no, no
(It's just sex and violence, melody and silence)
(It's just sex and violence, melody and violence)
(It's just sex and silence, melody and silence)
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)
(It's just sex and violence, melody and silence)
(I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down)
(It's just sex and violence, melody and violence)
Been down
Ever been down
(I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no)
(It's just sex and violence, melody and violence)
Ever been down
(I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no)
Ever been down
Ever been down
Have you ever been down?
Have you ever been down?
Have you ever been down?
