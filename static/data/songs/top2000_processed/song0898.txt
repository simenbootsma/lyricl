Hey, hey, hey
I'm a fire starter, twisted fire starter
Hey, hey, hey

I'm the pain you tasted, fell intoxicated
Hey, hey, hey
I'm a fire starter, twisted fire starter
Hey, hey, hey
You're a fire starter, twisted fire starter
Hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey

I'm the self-inflicted mind detonator, yeah
I'm the one infected, twisted animator
Hey, hey, hey
I'm a fire starter, twisted fire starter
Hey, hey, hey
You're a fire starter, twisted fire starter
Hey, hey, hey
