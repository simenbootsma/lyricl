The Turn Of A Friendly Card - The Alan Parsons Project
(lead vocal - chris rainbow)
There are unsmiling faces in fetters and chains
On a wheel of perpetual motion
Who belong to all races and answer all names
With no show of outward emotion
And they think it will make their lives easier
But the doorway before them is barred
And the game never ends when your whole world depends
On the turn of a friendly card
No the game never ends when your whole world depends
On the turn of a friendly card
