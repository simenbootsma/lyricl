The Promise You Made - Cock Robin

If I laid down my love
To come to your defense
Would you worry for me
With a pain in your chest?
Could I rely on your faith to be strong
To pick me back up and to push me along?
Tell me

You'll be there in my hour of need
You won't turn me away
Help me out of the life I lead
Remember the promise you made
Remember the promise you made

If I gave you my soul
For a piece of your mind
Would you carry me with you
To the far edge of time?
Could you understand if you found me untrue
Would we become one, or divided in two
Please tell me

You'll be there in my hour of need
You won't turn me away
Help me out of the life I lead
Remember the promise you made

Could I rely on your faith to be strong
To pick me back up and to push me along?
Please tell me

You'll be there in my hour of need
You won't turn me away
Help me out of the life I lead
Remember the promise you made
Remember the promise you made
Remember the promise you made
Remember the promise you made
