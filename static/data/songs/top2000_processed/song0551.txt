Lea - The Cats
How do you feel
Lovin' a rose
Guarding her life day and night
How do you feel
Losin' that rose
Killed by a storm you can't fight
Lea, Lea
Girl, now you're gone
Leaving, leaving behind
The memory of your smile
That will never leave my mind
Where are those words?
I heard you say
You would forever be mine
Where are those words?
How can I pray
Losin' a love so divine
Lea, Lea
Girl, now you're gone
Leaving, leaving behind
The memory of your smile
That will never leave my mindLea, Lea
Girl, now you're gone
Leaving, leaving behind
The memory of your smile
That will never leave my mind
Lea, Lea
Girl, now you're gone
