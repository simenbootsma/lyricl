Where Did You Sleep Last Night  - Nirvana

Fuck you all, this is the last song of the evening
What is it?
This was written by (Uh, what?) my favorite performer. Our favorite performer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?
Oh! And there's a donation basket. Kurt wants to buy Lead Belly's guitar
Oh yeah, this guy representing the Lead Belly estate wants to sell me Lead Belly's guitar for five hundred thousand dollars
We're passing a basket if anyone-
Yeah, I even asked David Gesâ€” Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me and he wouldn't do it. Okay

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
Shiver for me


My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, the pines the sun don't shine


Thank you
