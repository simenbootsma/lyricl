I Feel Love - Donna Summer


Ooh, it's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good, it's so good
Ooh, heaven knows, heaven knows
Heaven knows, heaven knows, heaven knows
Ooh, I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love, I feel love

I feel love
I feel love


Ooh, fallin' free, fallin' free
Fallin' free, fallin' free, fallin' free
Ooh, you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me, you and me
Ooh, I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love, I feel love

I feel love
I feel love
I feel love


Ooh, I'll get you, I'll get you
I'll get you, I'll get you, I'll get you
Ooh, what you do, what you do
What you do, what you do, what you do
Ooh, I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love, I feel love

I feel love
I feel love
I feel love
I feel love
I feel love...
