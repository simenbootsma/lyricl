Big Log - Robert Plant

My love is in league
With the freeway
Its passion will rise
As the cities fly by
And the tail-lights dissolve
In the coming of night
And the questions in thousands
Take flight

My love is the miles
And the waiting
The eyes that just stare
And the glance at the clock
And the secret that burns
And the pain that won't stop

And its fuel is the years
Leading me on!
Leading me down the road!
Driving me on!
Driving me on!

My love is exceeding
The limit
Red-eyed and fevered
With the hum of the miles
Distance and longing
My thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while
At the side?

Your love is cradled
In knowing
Eyes in the mirror
Still expecting they'll come
Sensing too well
When the journey is done
There is no turning back
No!
There is no turning back
On the run

My love
Is in league with the freeway
Oh! The freeway
And the coming of night-time
My love
My love
Is in league with the freeway
