Diamonds And Pearls - Prince & The New Power Generation

This will be the day
That you will hear me say
That I will never run away
I am here for you
Love is meant for two
Now tell me what you're gonna do

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
?
If I could, I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

Which one of us is right
If we always fight?
Why can't we just let love decide (Let love decide)
?
Am I the weaker man
Because I understand
That love must be the master plan (Love is the master plan)
?

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
?
If I could, I would give you the world

D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love
D to the I to the A to the M (To the M)
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love

There will come a time (There'll come a time)
When love will blow your mind (Blow your mind)
And everything you'll look for you'll find (Take a look inside, yeah)
That will be the time (That will be the time)
That everything will shine (Forever)
So bright it makes you colorblind (You will be colorblind)

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
?
If I could, I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (Pearls, yeah, yeah)
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
?
If I could, I would give you the world (Give you the world)
All I can do is just offer you my love (All I can do)
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (Diamonds)
Would you be, would you, would you, a happy boy or a girl?
(Would ya, would ya, would ya be happy, little baby?)
If I could, I would give you the world
