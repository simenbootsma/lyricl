The Saints Are Coming - U2 & Green Day

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy
God, I know I'm one

I cried to my daddy on the telephone: "How long now"?
Until the clouds unroll and you come down, the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent

I cried to my daddy on the telephone: "How long now"?
Until the clouds unroll and you come home, the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent

Boom, cha, hey!

The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply
The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realize there's no reply

A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief, how long now?
Until a weather change condemns belief, how long now?

Boom, cha, hey!

The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply
