You Have Been Loved - George Michael

She takes the back road and the lane
Past the school that has not changed
In all this time
She thinks of when the boy was young
All the battles she had won
Just to give him life
That man, she loved that man
For all his life
But now, we meet to take him flowers
And only God knows why

For what's the use in pressing palms
When children fade in mothers' arms?
It's a cruel world, we've so much to lose
And what we have to learn
We rarely choose
So if it's God who took her son
He cannot be the one
Living in her mind

"Take care, my love", she said
"Don't think that God is dead"
"Take care, my love", she said

If I was weak, forgive me
But I was terrified
You brushed my eyes with angels' wings
Full of love
The kind that makes devils cry
So, these days, my life has changed
And I'll be fine (And I'll be fine)
But she just sits and counts the hours
Searching for her crime

So what's the use in pressing palms
If you won't keep such love from harm?
It's a cruel world, you've so much to prove
And Heaven help the ones
Who wait for you

Now I've no daughters, I've no sons
Guess I'm the only one
Living in my life

"Take care, my love", he said
"Don't think that God is dead"
"Take care, my love", he said
"You have been loved"
