Romeo And Juliet  - Dire Straits

A love-struck Romeo sings a streetsuss serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it?"
Juliet says, "Hey, it's Romeo
You nearly gave me a heart attack"
He's underneath the window
She's singing, "Hey la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here
Singing up to people like that
Anyway, what ya gonna do about it?"

"Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, when you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?"

Come up on different streets
They both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean
Yes, and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you
And now your dream is real
How can you look at me
As I was just another one of your deals
?
Well you can fall for chains of silver
You can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers
And the promises they hold
You promised me everything
You promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah

"Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you â€˜til I die
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?"

"I can't do the talks like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat to bad company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you anytime"

"Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I die
There's a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?"

And a love-struck Romeo sings a streetsuss serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it?"
"You and me babe, how about it?"
