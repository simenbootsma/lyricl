Weekend Love - Golden Earring
The sooner it will be the better
Gonna have to see her right away
It's been a long time since the day I met her
I can't handle being without her one more day
Gonna get the feeling that I'm going insane
Feel so stupid using these old cliches
You better hurry up Baby, I ain't lying
We're down to nothing but a waste of time
Still remember everything she said
Make no promises, make no debts
All I want is your one day weekend love
She nips her wine without a flinching
She's in control of it all the way
Looks so good, pretending that she's listening
By the time I fall asleep, she's gone away
She's got no mercy on a jealous heart
And she said it all right from the start
Make no promises, make no debts
But I love that lady, I got to confess
I want more than just a one day weekend love
I want more than just a one day weekend love
All she wants is just my one day weekend love
The sooner it will be the better
Gonna have to see her right away
It's been a week now since she's been around here
I can't handle being without her one more day
Honey, get the feeling that I'm going insane
Feel so stupid using these old cliches
She's got no mercy on a jealous heart
And she said it all right from the start
Make no promises, make no debts
But I love that lady, I got to confessI want more than just a one day weekend love
I want more than just a one day weekend love
All she wants is just my one day weekend love
The sooner it will be the better
Gonna have to see her right away
It's been a week now since she's been around here

Honey, get the feeling that I'm going insane
