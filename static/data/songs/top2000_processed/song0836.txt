Silver Springs - Fleetwood Mac

You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashin'
I would be your only dream
Your shinin' autumn ocean crashin'

And don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't wanna know

So, I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say, "I loved you years ago"
Tell myself you never loved me, no

And don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't wanna know, oh, no
And can you tell me, was it worth it?
Baby, I don't wanna know

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you


Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well, I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
I'll follow you down
'Til the sound of my voice will haunt you
Oh, give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Was I just a fool?
I'll follow you down
'Til the sound of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
I'll follow you down
'Til the sound
