Don't Give Up The Fight - Racoon

Please don't give up the fight
For no reason but your own
I never said that the fight would be easy
Because it won't
I will remember you, and all that we've been through
There is no angel, that can be more angel than you
I see you every night, when your star is shining bright
And I cry, and I smile, I wish you where here with me

Well, I am so proud to be your father
I'm so proud to be your mom
And I am so proud to be your brother
So may this be your song

Please don't give up the fight
For no reason but your own
'Cause I never said the fight would be easy
Because it won't
I will come look for you
When this life is through, with this body
Before now I still need to live
For we are not alone, and you are not alone
We're at home, loving and waiting

But I am so proud to be your father
So proud to be your mom
And I'll always be proud to be your brother
So may this be your song

Please don't give up the fight for no reason
