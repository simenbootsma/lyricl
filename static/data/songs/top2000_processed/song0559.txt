Narcotic - Liquido

So you face it with a smile
There is no need to cry
For a trifle's more than this
Will you still recall my name
And the month it all began?
Will you release me with a kiss?
Have I tried to draw the veil?
If I have, how could I fail?
Did I fear the consequence?

Dazed by careless words
Cozy in my mind

I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go

Now you shaped that liquid wax
Fit it out with crater cracks
Sweet devotion, my delight
Oh, you're such a pretty one
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
Would tease me through the night
Now, I hate to leave you bare
If you need me, I'll be there

Dazed by careless words
Cozy in my mind

I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go

And I touched your face
Narcotic mind from lazed, Mary-Jane
And I called your name
Like an addicted to cocaine
Calls for the stuff he'd rather blame
And I touched your face
Narcotic mind from lazed, Mary-Jane
And I called your name
My cocaine

I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go
I don't mind, I think so
I will let you go
