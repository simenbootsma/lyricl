Message To My Girl - Split Enz
I don't want to say, "I love you"
That would give away too much
It's hip to be detached and precious
The only thing you feel is vicious
I don't want to say, "I want you"
Even though I want you so much
It's wrapped up in conversation
It's whispered in a hush
Though I'm frightened by the words
Think it's time I made it heard
No more empty self-possession
Visions swept under the mat
It's no New Year's resolution
It's more than that
Now, I wake up happy
Warm in a lover's embrace
No one else can touch us
While we're in this place
So I'll sing it to the world
This simple message to my girlNo more empty self-possession
Visions swept under the mat
It's no New Year's resolution
It's more than that
Though I'm frightened by the words
Think it's time I made it heard
So I'll sing it to the world
A simple message to my girl
No more empty self-possession
Visions swept under the mat
It's no New Year's resolution
It's more than that
Oh, there's nothing quite as real
As the touch of your sweet hand
I can't spend the rest of my life
Buried in the sand
Oh, every night I hear you call my name
I'm gonna sleep in my thoughts that roam
Oh, every night to express my pain
But I won't get wrapped in your tomb
No, I don't care, I don't care why you've gone now
And every night sings the same song, same song
I hear hear humming in my sleep
I don't want to say
I don't want to sayI can't spend the rest of my life
Buried in the sand
