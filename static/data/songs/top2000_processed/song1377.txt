Tumble And Fall - Johan
Where everything looks so much better on the outside
Where every day's the same, will turn into a long night
Paid too much for losing touch
Because the apathy will crack me up in no time
Because insanity becomes a state of mind
It comes around again
That warning sound can wake me from my sleep
I've gotten into deep
But when you call I'll be ready for the flash
Got too heavy on the dark side
Tumble and fall
I've come a long way to get it back my friend
You took the credit for my lost right
How come it's still going on?
And when the councelling, it doesn't bring the silence
And when the craziness becomes a boring ride
I'll be around again
With every vow you take the best of me
The last thing that I needed
When you call I'll be ready for the flash
Got to heavy on the dark side
Tumble and fall
I've come a long way to get it back my friend
You took the credit for my lost right
How come it's still going on?The time has come to ditch the agony and make another start
The time is up, I break the line and leave these words behind
Take back what was mine all along
When you call I'll be ready for the flash
Got to heavy on the dark side
Tumble and fall
I've come along way to get it back my friend
You took the credit for my lost right
How come it's still going on?
Way to get it back my friend
You took the credit for my lost right
How come I'm still going strong?
