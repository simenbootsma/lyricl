No Limit - 2 Unlimited

Let me hear you say yeah! (Yeah!)
Let me hear you say yeah! (Yeah!)


No no, no no no no, no no no no, no no there's no limit
No no, no no no no, no no no no, no no there's no limit

No, no limits, we'll reach for the sky
No valley too deep, no mountain too high
No, no limits, won't give up the fight
We do what we want, and we do it with pride

Let me hear you say yeah! (Yeah!)

Hard to the core, I feel the floor
When I'm on the stage, yo, you'll ask for more
I'm on the edge, I know the ledge
I work real hard to collect my cash
Tick tick ticka tick take your time
When I'm goin' I'm goin' for mine
Open you ears and you will hear it

No no, no no no no, no no no no, no no there's no limit
No no, no no no no, no no no no, no no there's no limit


No, no limits, we'll reach for the sky
No valley too deep, no mountain too high
No, no limits, won't give up the fight
We do what we want, and we do it with pride

Hey-hey-yeah-hey-hey-now-now!
Now-now-hey-hey-yeah-hey-hey-now-now! (Ouh!)

No limits allowed, cause there's much crowd
Microphone check as I choose my rhyme
I'm playing on the road, I've got no fear
The sound from my mouth is the rap you hear
No valley too deep, no mountain too high
Reach the top, touch the sky!
They tried to diss me cause I sell out


No, no limits, we'll reach for the sky
No valley too deep, no mountain too high
No, no limits, won't give up the fight
We do what we want, and we do it with pride
