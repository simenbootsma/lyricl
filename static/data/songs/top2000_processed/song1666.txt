Lost Without You - Krezip

I hold your hand and squeeze it softly, 'cause I realize
I love you more now than I ever did before
For the bitter and the sweet and through these weary times
And I’ve never thought of letting you go
I've never ever thought of letting you go

I'd be lost without you
You’re someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Oh, look at us now
I'd be lost without you
You're someone to care for
Someone to be there for
Oh, look at us now

We will make it through somehow
We will make it through somehow

I know you're scared and there's a million things to worry 'bout
I know you're tired, you're afraid of what you’ll dream
And you can yell at me, be mad at me, just cry it out
I’ve never thought of letting you go

I’d be lost without you
You're someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Oh, look at us now
I'd be lost without you
You're someone to care for
Someone to be there for
Oh, look at us now

We will make it through somehow
We will make it through somehow

Just let me hold your hand through night and day
And I will kiss your every fear away
Now listen closely to these words I say
I’ve never thought of letting you go
No, I've never thought of letting you go

I'd be lost without you
You're someone to fight for
Someone to die for
Oh, look at us now
Lost without you
You're someone to care for
Someone to be there for
Oh, look at us now
I'd be lost without you
You're someone to fight for
Someone to die for

We will make it through somehow
We will make it through somehow
We will make it through somehow
