This Is What It Feels Like - Armin van Buuren ft. Trevor Guthrie

Nobody here knocking at my door (door, door, door)
The sound of silence, I can't take anymore (more, more, more)
Nobody ringing my telephone now (now, now, now)
Oh, how I miss such a beautiful sound (sound, sound, sound)

And I don't even know how I survive
I won't make it to the shore without your light
No, I don't even know if I'm alive
Oh-oh-oh-oh, without you now
This is what it feels like

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Nothing to hold but the memories in frames
Oh, they remind of the battle I face (face, face, face)
Without your love, without you I drown
(ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

And I don't even know how I survivе
I won't make it to the shore without your light
No, I don't еven know if I'm alive
Oh-oh-oh-oh, without you now
This is what it feels like

(like, like, like, like)
(like, like, like, like)
(like, like, like, like)
