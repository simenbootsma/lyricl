Pain And Misery  - The Teskey Brothers

I've been in love, honey, you know it’s true
Was since that day I first laid my eyes on you
Love is a crazy game, baby
It's how I feel
It make you oh, so high
But it takes so long to heal

So please yeah yeah
Won't you stay with me?
’Cause since you gone, it's all
Pain and misery
Honey, please yeah yeah
Won't you stay with me?
'Cause since you gone
It's pain and misery

Sometimes I curse that day of when you came along
I was happy
But it's been pain now for so very long
Oh, I'm begging you, honey
Please, won't you stay?
’Cause I been so lonely

Everyday is pain
In the end, it’s hard to see
Every fateful day is oh, so sad
Now that I've lost the best friend that I ever had

Honey, please
Won’t you stay with me?
'Cause since you gone it's all
Pain and misery
Honey, please, whoa please
Won't you stay with me?
’Cause since you gone
It's pain and misery

Hey
I'm begging you, honey
Whoa
I want you to love me
Yeah, I want you to love me
I need you so bad
