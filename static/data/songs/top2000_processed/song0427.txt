Cloudbusting - Kate Bush

I still dream of Orgonon
I wake up crying
You're making rain
And you're just in reach
When you and sleep escape me

You're like my yo-yo that glowed in the dark
What made it special made it dangerous
So I bury it and forget

But every time it rains you're here in my head
Like the Sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen

On top of the world, looking over the edge
You could see them coming
You looked too small in their big black car
To be a threat to the men in the power

I hid my yo-yo in the garden
I can't hide you from the government

'Cause every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the Sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen


And every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the Sun coming out
Look, your son's coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen, oh
Ooh, just saying it could even make it happen

Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
“We're cloudbusting, daddy”
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo

Your son's coming out
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Your Son's coming out
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
