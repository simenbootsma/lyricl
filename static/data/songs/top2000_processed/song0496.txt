Tribute - Tenacious D

This is the greatest and best song in the world…
…tribute

Long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here
We was hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said, “Play the best song in the world
Or I'll eat your soul” (Soul)

Well, me and Kyle, we looked at each other
And we each said, “Okay”
And we played the first thing that came to our heads, just so happened to be
The best song in the world, it was the best song in the world

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two, two and one make three
It was destiny
Once every hundred-thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow

Needless to say, the beast was stunned
A whip-crack went his whippy tail and the beast was done
He asked us *snort* “Be you angels?”
And we said, “Nay, we are but men!” Rock
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah
Ohhh, whoah
Ah-whoah-oh

This is not the greatest song in the world, no
This is just a tribute
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, no
No, this is a tribute, oh
To the greatest song in the world, alright
It was the greatest song in the world, alright
Yeah, it was the best motherfucking song
The greatest song in the world

Ah-rah, dee
Soo-guh-goo-gee-goo-gee
Goo-guh fli-goo gee-goo
Guh fli-goo, ga-goo-buh-dee
Ooh, guh-goo-bee
Ooh-guh-guh-bee-guh-guh-bee
Fli-goo gee-goo

And the peculiar thing is this, my friends
The song we sang on that fateful night
It didn't actually sound anything like this song

This is just a tribute, you've gotta believe me
And I wish you were there, just a matter of opinion
Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin'
So surprised to find you can't stop it
A fiery ring of fire, rich motherfucker, aw
Alright
Alright
