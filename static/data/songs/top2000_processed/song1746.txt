Sharks - Imagine Dragons

(Ha ha ha ha ha)

Trouble
Blood is in the rocky waters
Hide away your sons and daughters
Eat you alive
Levels
Better put your head on swivels
Dancin' with the very devil
Butter to knife

You think you're better than them
Better than them
You think they're really your friends
Really your friends
But when it comes to the end
To the end
You're just the same as them
Same as them (Ha ha ha ha ha)

So lеt it go, let it go
That's the way that it goes
First you'rе in, then you're out
Everybody knows
You're hot, then you're cold
You're a light in the dark
Just you wait and you'll see

He's comin' to get you
(Chick, chicka) Woop, woop
He's comin' to get you, get
(Chicka) Woop

Bubbles
Drownin', you're seein' doubles
Don't you let them see your struggles
Hidin' your tears
Crisis
Take advantage of your niceness
Cut you up in even slices
Prey on your fears

You think you're better than them
Better than them (You think you're better)
You think they're really your friends
Really your friends (Really your friends
)
But when it comes to the end
To the end (Oh, no)
You're just the same as them

So let it go, let it go
That's the way that it goes
First you're in, then you're out
Everybody knows (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You're hot, then you're cold
You're a light in the dark
Just you wait and you'll see
That you're swimmin' with sharks

(My blood is pumpin') He's comin' to get you
(Don't take it from me) Woop, woop
(My blood is pumpin') He's comin' to get you, get
(Don't take it from me)
(My blood is pumpin') He's comin' to get you
(Don't take it from me) Woop, woop
(My blood is pumpin') He's comin' to get you, get
(Don't take it from me)

Every time my heart is beatin', I can feel the recipe
I wonder if my day is coming, blame it on the entropy
My blood is pumpin', I can see the end is right in front of me
Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything
(Sharks)
Don't take it from me
My blood is pumpin', my blood is pumpin' (Sharks)

So let it go, let it go
That's the way that it goes
First you're in, then you're out
Everybody knows (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You're hot, then you're cold
You're a light in the dark
Just you wait and you'll see
That you're swimmin' with sharks

(My blood is pumpin') He's comin' to get you
(Don't take it from me) Woop, woop
(My blood is pumpin') He's comin' to get you, get
(Don't take it from me)
(My blood is pumpin') He's comin' to get you
(Don't take it from me)
(My blood is pumpin') He's comin' to get you, get
(Don't take it from me)
