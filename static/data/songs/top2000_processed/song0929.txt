Come On Eileen  - Dexy's Midnight Runners


Come on, Eileen
Come on, Eileen

Poor old Johnnie Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them?
You're grown (You're grown up)
So grown (So grown up)
Now I must say more than ever (Come on, Eileen)
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye
And we can sing just like our fathers

Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear (Well, he means)
At this moment
You mean everything
You in that dress
My thoughts, I confess
Verge on dirty

Come on, Eileen

These people 'round here
Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke-dried face
They're resigned to what their fate is
But no, not us (No, never)
No, not us (No, never)
We are far too young and clever (Remember)
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever

Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear (Well, he means)
Ah, come on, let's
Take off everything
That pretty red dress
Eileen (Tell him yes)
Ah, come on, let's
Ah, come on, Eileen
That pretty red dress
Eileen (Tell him yes)
Ah, come on, let's
Ah, come on, Eileen

(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
Now you are grown, now you have shown (Toora, toora, ta-loora)
Oh, Eileen, said
Come on, Eileen (You've grown)
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
These things, they are real and I know (So grown)
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
How you feel
Now I must say more than ever (Toora, toora, ta-loora)
Things 'round here have changed, I said
Toora, loora, toora, loo-rye-aye
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
(Come on, Eileen, ta-loo-rye-aye)
(Toora, toora, ta-loora)

Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear (Well, he means)
At this moment
You mean everything
You in that dress
My thoughts, I confess
Verge on dirty
Ah, come on, Eileen
Come on, Eileen
Oh, I swear (Well, he means)
At this moment
You mean everything
In that dress
Oh, my thoughts, I confess
Well, they're dirty
Come on, Eileen
Come on, Eileen
Woah (Well, he means)
Oh-ho-ho-ho
Ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on (Everything)
In that dress

Oh, believe me, if all those endearing young charms
That I gaze on so fondly today
Were to suddenly leave you or fly in the night
Just like fairy gifts gone in the sky
