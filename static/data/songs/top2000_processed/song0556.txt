You'll Be In My Heart - Phil Collins

Come stop your crying
It will be alright
Just take my hand
Hold it tight
I will protect you from all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry
For one so small
You seem so strong
My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm
This bond between us can't be broken
I will be here
Don't you cry

'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart

Why can't they understand the way we feel?
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different, but deep inside us
We're not that different at all

And you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more

Don't listen to them, 'cause what do they know? (What do they know?)
We need each other, to have, to hold
They'll see in time, I know
When destiny calls you, you must be strong (You gotta be strong)
I may not be with you, but you've got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know
We'll show them together

'Cause you'll be in my heart
Believe me, you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on
Now and forever moreYou'll be in my heart (You'll be here in my heart)
No matter what they say (I'll be with you)
You'll be here in my heart (I'll be there)
Always

Always I'll be with you
I'll be there for you always
Always and always
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there
Always
