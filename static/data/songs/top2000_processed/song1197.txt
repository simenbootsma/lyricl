In A Lifetime - Clannad & Bono
Hard to tell
Or recognise a sign
To see me through
A warning sign
(First the thunder)
Satisfied, if the past it will not lie
(Then the storm torn asunder)
The future you and I get blown away
(In the storm, in a lifetime)
And as the rain it falls, heavy in my heart
Begin again, as the storm breaks through
Believe the light in you
So the light shines in you
Without color, faded and worn
Torn asunder in the storm
Unless the sound has faded from your soul
Unless it disappears
(First the thunder, then the storm)
Selfish storm, hold on the inside
(Torn asunder in the storm)
One life in the stormIn a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
In a lifetime
