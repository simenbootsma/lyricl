Eloise - Barry Ryan

Every night I'm there
I'm always there, she knows I'm there
And heaven knows
I hope she goes

I find it hard
To realize that love was in her eyes
It's dying now
She knows I'm crying now

And every night I'm there
I break my heart to please!

Eloise
Eloise

You know I'm on my knees, yeah!
I said please

You're all I want
So, hear my prayer!

My Eloise
Is like the stars that please the night
The sun that makes the day
That lights the way

And when that star goes by
I'll hold it in my hands and cry
Her love is mine
My sun will shine

Every night I'm there
I break my heart to please!

Eloise
Da da, da da da, da de
Eloise

Ah!

You're all I want

My Eloisa
I'd love to please her
I'd love to care
But she's not there
And when I find you
I'd be so kind
You'd want to stay
I know you'd stay
Do dee do de doo
Do dee do de doo doo doo

And as the days grow old
The nights grow cold, I wanna hold
Her near to me, yeah!
I know she's dear to me

And only time can tell
And take away this lonely hell
I'm on my knees
To Eloise

And every night I'm there

Eloise
Da da, da da da, da de
Eloise

You are my life
So, hear my prayer!
You are the price
I know you're there

You're all I need
And I'm not there

You know I'm not there
No! No! No!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

She knows I love her, love her, love her, love love love love love her
