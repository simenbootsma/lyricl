Budapest - George Ezra

My house in Budapest, my
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo

You, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all

My acres of a land
I have achieved
It may be hard for you to
Stop and believe

But for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all

And give me one good reason why I should never make a change

My many artifacts
The list goes on
If you just say the words, I'll
I'll up and run

Oh, to you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, ooh
I'd leave it all

And give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me, then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me, then all of this will go away

Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh

My friends and family, they don't understand

But for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd lose it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd lose it all

And give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me, then all of this will go away
Give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me, then all of this will go away

My house in Budapest, my
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo

You, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
