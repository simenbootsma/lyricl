Help! - The Beatles

(Help!) I need somebody
(Help!) Not just anybody
(Help!) You know I need someone
(Help!)

(Mmm, when I was young) When-when I was younger, so much younger than today
(I never need) I never needed anybody's help in any way
(Now these days are gone) But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
(And now I find) Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

(Now my life has changed) And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
(My independ) My independence seems to vanish in the haze
(But now and then) But every now and then I feel so insecure
(I know that I) I know that I just need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground

Help me! Help me, ooh
