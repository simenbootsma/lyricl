Still Believe - Herman Brood & His Wild Romance
You make me feel
Like I've drawn
A loser's card
But every time you walk out of me
I find myself left
With a broken heart
But it ain't my way to quit mom
I came to win child
May have run out of luck
But I'm pretty shure
It's gonna come back again
It's gonna come back
Keep on tryin' child - keep on tryin'
Keep on tryin' - keep on tryin'
Cause I
Still believe that I can win (3 x)
Your love
Found myself in a freight train
Rolling down the track
To the hazy landscape
Goin' to town
I scored myself some hard porno
New Playboy, the new Penthouse
Doin' the hand jive
Just to kill the time
But it ain't my way to quit mom
I came to win
May have run out of luck
But I'm pretty shure
It's gonna come back again
It's gonna come - it's gonna come back
Keep on tryin' - keep on tryin'
Gonna keep on tryin' - keep on tryin'Still believe that I can win (4 x)
Your love
