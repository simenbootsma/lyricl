Damn Those Eyes - Kane
Damn those eyes
They keep me torn inside
She runs like a river through me
Always you
Eyes don't lie, words may try
She comes like a mystery... flows through me
And I swear it's true.....always you....
I wish I could run in to you now (2x)
If I see you one more time, maybe I'd feel better
If I'd see you one more time
Maybe I'd feel not so cold
Damn those eyes
No matter how I try
She raigns with her symphony.. over me
Words may try... I say eyes don't lie
She speaks with her tender voice 'till there's no choice
And I swear it's true... always you...
I wish I could run in to you now (2x)
If I see you one more time, maybe I'd feel better
If I'd see you one more time
Maybe I'd feel not so cold
