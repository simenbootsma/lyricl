Kingston Town - UB40

The night seems to fade
But the moonlight lingers on
There are wonders for everyone
The stars shine so bright
But they're fading after dawn
There is magic in Kingston Town

Oh, Kingston Town
The place I long to be
If I had the whole world
I would give it away
Just to see the girls at play

And when I am king
Surely I would need a queen
And a palace and everything, yeah
And now I am king
And my queen will come at dawn
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town


Oh, Kingston Town
The place I long to be
If I had the whole world
I would give it away

When I am king
Surely I would need a queen
And a palace and everything, yeah
And now I am king
And my queen will come at dawn
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town

She'll be waiting in Kingston Town, right on
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town, oh, yeah
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town, oh, oh
She'll be waitingâ€”
