Best Song Ever - One Direction

Maybe it's the way she walked (Ow!)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards (Ow!)
Just like she already owned it

I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went, "Oh, oh, oh," I think it went, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
I think it goes (Woo!)

Said her name was Georgia Rose (Ow!)
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)

I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember (How it goes, but I know)
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went, "Oh, oh, oh," I think it went, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
I think it goes (Woo!)

You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How we danced (Oh, oh, oh, one, two, one, two, three, ow!)

How we danced all night to the best song ever (How we danced)
We knew every line, now I can't remember (We knew every line)
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night (We danced, we danced) to the best song ever (It goes something like this)
And we danced all night to the best song ever (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We knew every line, now I can't remember (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that I won't forget her)

I think it went, "Oh, oh, oh," I think it went, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
I think it goes (Woo!)

Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
