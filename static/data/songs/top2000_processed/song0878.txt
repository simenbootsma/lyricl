Michel - Anouk
Hey Michel, how's life are you okay
I wonder if you ever think of me
It's been 9 years since that kiss
I can't help but reminisce
Hey Michel
Do you remember
We walked the street to the beat
Hand in hand you and me
Smiling faces so in love
Hoping that they all could see
That we belonged together you and me against the world
But we found out the hard way cause it wasn't meant to be
Now it's you and her I see
You were my first and worst love
And so it only could go wrong
But ain't that just the way you learn
Hey Michel
I just wanted to let you know
That someone else has stolen my heart
And now another girl has caught your eye
That doesn't mean I don't think of you
I am just hoping that she'll treat you rightDo you remember
How we walked the street to the beat
Hand in hand and you and me
Smiling faces so in love
Hoping that they all could see
That we belonged together you and me against the world
But we found out the hard way cause it wasn't meant to be
Now it is you and her I see
It was just a silly dream
Hey Michel
Do you remember
