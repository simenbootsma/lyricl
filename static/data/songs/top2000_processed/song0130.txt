With Or Without You - U2

See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you

Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I'll wait without you

With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all, but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you, ah-hah
I can't live
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give

My hands are tied
My body bruised
She got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live
With or without you

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live with or without you

Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
