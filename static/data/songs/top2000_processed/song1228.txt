Do They Know It's Christmas - Band Aid

It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

Where the only water flowing

And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom

Well, tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Here's to you

Raise a glass for everyone

Here's to them


Do they know it's Christmas time at all?
