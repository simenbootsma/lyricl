Strange Machines  - The Gathering

It has always been in the back of my mind
Dreaming about going to the corners of time
I always wanted to fly in strange machines

I wanna do centuries in a lifetime
And feel it with my hands
Touch the World War II and Cleopatra
Flying...

Could it be that my dream would come true
Building a machine that would actually do
What I want it to do

Russian revolution, let's do that in one day
Beethoven and Gershwin, I think that would be OK
More than anything I wanna fly in strange machines

I wanna do centuries in a lifetime
And see it with my eyes
Watch Jesus rise, if he ever did

I wanna do centuries in a lifetime
And feel it with my hands
Touch the Renaissance and Chaka Khan
Flying...
