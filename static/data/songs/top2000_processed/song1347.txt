Lover, You Should've Come Over - Jeff Buckley

Looking out the door, I see the rain
Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind
So you never know

Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child?
You know how much I need it

Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run

Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done

So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return?
Oh, will I ever learn?

Oh, oh, oh
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
Mhm

Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him

My body turns and yearns
For a sleep that won't ever come

It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She's the tear that hangs inside my soul foreve

Oh, but maybe I'm just too young

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Lover, you should've come over
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, I, I feel too young to hold on
And much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
How long will I wait for you?
Lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
