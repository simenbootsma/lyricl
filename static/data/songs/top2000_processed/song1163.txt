Lust For Life - Iggy Pop

Here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs and the flesh machine
He's gonna do another striptease
Hey man, where'd you get that lotion?
I been hurtin' since I bought the gimmick
About somethin' called love
Yeah, somethin' called love
Well, that's like hypnotizin' chickens

Well, I'm just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
'Cause I've a lust for life
'Cause I've a lust for life

I'm worth a million in prizes
With my torture film
, drive a GTO
Wear a uniform, all on a government loan
I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah, I'm through with sleepin' on the sidewalk
No more beatin' my brains
No more beatin' my brains
With the liquor and drugs

Well, I am just a modern guy
Of course, I've had it in the ear before
'Cause I've a lust for life
(Lust for life)
'Cause I've a lust for life (Ooh)
I got a lust for life (Ooh)
Got a lust for life (Ooh)
Oh, a lust for life (Ooh)
Oh, a lust for life (Ooh)
A lust for life (Ooh)
I got a lust for life (Ooh)
A lotta lust for life
Well, I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
Well, I've a lust for life
'Cause I've a lust for life

Well, here comes Johnny Yen again
With the liquor and drugs, and the flesh machine
I know he's gonna do another striptease
Hey man, where'd you get that lotion?
Your skin starts itchin' once you buy the gimmick
About somethin' called love
Oh, love, love, love

Well, I am just a modern guy
Of course I've had it in the ear before
And I've a lust for life
(Lust for life)
'Cause I've a lust for life
(Lust for life)
Got a lust for life
Yeah, a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Oh, a lust for life
I got a lust for life
Yeah, a lust for life
I got a lust for life
A lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life
A lust for life
