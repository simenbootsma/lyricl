Rosie - Claw Boys Claw
Rainbow child, I used to call that name a lot
When love was doin' well
Being a star, took all of you away from me
But most of all from yourself
Got what you're lookin' for
Wavin' bye to the poor
Got what you're gazing at
Understanding and respect
Oh, Rosie, got it made, got it made
Got it made, got it made
Oh yeah, Rosie, got it made, got it made
Got it made, got it made
Rainbow, star, oh, you fly to high above our heads
Just held up by a string
Look out, Rose, 'cause the fall is comin'
Your shadow tells the state you're in
Got what you're lookin' for
Wavin' bye to the poor
Got what you're gazing at
Understanding and respect
Oh, Rosie, got it made, got it made
Got it made, got it made
Oh yeah, Rosie, got it made, got it made
Got it made, got it madeGot what you're lookin' for
Wavin' bye to the poor
Tell me, girl, what is it like
To be a goddess overnight, yeah
What do you fear the most
Suicide or local dope?
Oh, Rosie, got it made, got it made
Got it made, got it made
Oh yeah, Rosie, got it made, got it made
Got it made, got it made
Oh, Rosie, got it made, got it made
Got it made, got it made
Oh yeah, Rosie, got it made, got it made
Got it made, got it made
Mmm...
