Someone Somewhere In Summertime - Simple Minds

Stay, I'm burning slow
With me in the rain
Walking in the soft rain
Calling out my name
See me burning slow

Brilliant days, wake up on brilliant days
Shadows of brilliant ways will change all the time
Memories, burning gold memories
Cold-of-day memories change me in these times

Somewhere there is some place that one million eyes can't see
And somewhere there is someone who can see what I can see

Someone somewhere in summertime
Someone somewhere in summertime
Someone somewhere in summertime
Someone somewhere in summertime

Stay, I'm burning slow
With me in the rain
Walking in the soft rain
Calling out my name

Moments burn, slow burning golden nights
Once more see city lights, holding candles to the flame
Brilliant days, wake up on brilliant days
Shadows of brilliant ways will change me all the time

Somewhere there is some place that one million eyes can't see
And somewhere there is someone who can see what I can see

Someone somewhere in summertime
Someone somewhere in summertime
Someone somewhere in summertime
Someone somewhere in summertime
Someone somewhere in summertime
Someone somewhere in summertime
Someone somewhere in summertime
