How Deep Is Your Love - Bee Gees

I know your eyes in the mornin' sun
I feel you touch me in the pourin' rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour

And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn (I really mean to learn)
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
(Na-na-na-na-na)
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
(Na-na-na-na-na)
How deep is your love? How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
