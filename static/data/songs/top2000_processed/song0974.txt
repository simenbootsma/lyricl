Chandelier - Sia

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anythin', when will I learn?
I push it down, I push it down
I'm the one for a good time call
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, I feel the love

One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier

But I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light

Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame
(Ah)

One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier

But I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light

On for tonight
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holdin' on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holdin' on for tonight
Oh, I'm just holdin' on for tonight
On for tonight, on for tonight
