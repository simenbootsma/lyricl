I Do - Douwe Bob & Jacqueline Govaert

This rain is not the cleansing kind
It drags you down and clouds your mind
And oh, you know, it chills me to the bone
Hold your tongue and hold my hand
I can only pray you'll understand
Without you I can only be alone
But I cannot repair this on my own

I shake us, I ache us
I break us in two
But I love you, I love you
I love you, I do

We have a certain time on Earth
And I've been told it's all a learning curve
I've learned not being with you is wasting time
But I'll do what's right, and let you go
'Cause I can see it only hurts your soul
I only wanna hold you in my arms
I'm afraid that if I touch you'd turn to dust

I shake us, I ache us
I break us in two
But I love you, I love you

Oh, the river flows away from me
I can't hold on, she must be free
And I'll be right here
Oh, I'll be right here

I shake us, I ache us
I break us in two
But I love you, I love you
I love you, I do

I love you, I do
