Somebody Will Know Someday - Cuby & the Blizzards
Somebody will know someday
Will know why you walked out of me
Somebody will know someday
Will know why you walked out of me
But nobody will know someday
Nobody will know that I will never agree
So many will see someday
Will see someday
The tears that fills your eyes
So many will see someday
The tears that fills your eyes
But nobody will see me
When I get reconciled
One misty morning
I'm gonna write your name in the sky
One misty morning
I'm gonna write your name in the sky
And after that babe
I run away at myself and cry
Maybe there comes a day
That you come walking up to me
Maybe there comes a day
That you come walking up to me
That day you know that I will be thereDon't you know that I still love you
Can't you see I'm hiding myself
In my lonely place, in my lonely place
