Don't Leave Me This Way - The Communards & Sarah Jane Morris

Don't leave me this way
I can't survive
I can't stay alive
Without your love, no baby

Don't leave me this way
I can't exist
I will surely miss your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way

Aww, baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control?
So come on down and satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free

Don't leave me this way
I don't understand how I'm at your command
So baby please, so don't you leave me this way

Aww, baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control?
So come on down and satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free

Come satisfy me, come satisfy me
Don't you leave me this way
No, no
No, no
No, baby don't you go

Don't leave me this way
I can't exist
I will surely miss your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way

Aww, baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control?
So come on down and satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free

(Don't leave me this way)
Don't you know by now?
Don't you know by now?
I'm losing control...
