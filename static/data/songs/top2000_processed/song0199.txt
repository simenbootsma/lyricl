Love You More - Racoon

Clouds above go sailing by
I found my meaning in this life
Clear white is flying in my eyes
Underneath a blue, blue sky
The waves come rolling in with the tide

I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more
You look like you did before, only prettier
Every day I love you more

All the people rushing by, by, by
Looking for meaning in this life
So used up, and blinded by lies
They're underneath the blue, blue sky
The way they seldom seem to smile
I don't know why

'Cause I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more
You look like you did before, only prettier
Every day I love you more
I love you more


'Cause I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more
You look like you did before, only prettier
And every day I missed you more
And more and more and more and more
I've been away too long
And every day I missed you more
Oh, you look like you did before, only prettier
Every day I love you more
I love you more
Every day I love you more
