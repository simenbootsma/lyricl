Marian - The Cats
Where are the roses that I bought you, my love?
Where are the poems that I wrote?
You cast your eyes down when I watch you, my love
Have I been too long on the road?
I came back to find a stranger in tears
She was once the girl I used to know for some years
Marian, tell me you still care for me
Marian, remember how good those days used to be
Marian, or don't you agree?
What kind of music fills your head now, my love?
What kind of grapes became your wine?
You tried to find out 'bout your feelings, my love
Were you ever thinking of mine?
I came back to find a stranger in tears
She was once the girl I used to know for some years
Marian, tell me you still care for me
Marian, remember how good those days used to be
Marian, or don't you agree?
I came back to find a stranger in tears
She was once the girl I used to know for some yearsMarian, tell me you still care for me
