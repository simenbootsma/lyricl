Bright Eyes - Rondé

Bright eyes, look at me now, you better believe it
Oh my

I'm so sick of this feeling
I’m bringing me down, I'm shutting me out
It's getting too easy (Mm)
I got stuck in a season
I’m done with the gray, I'm walking away
From all of my demons (Mm)

Time went by, I had to learn
Life won't change if you never take a turn
I felt blind for way too long
But now I've got

Bright eyes, look at me now, you better believe it
Oh my, I'm feeling so high, I'm touching the ceiling
Bright eyes, I'm finally here, I finally see that
I don't wanna live without thesе, I don’t wanna live without
Bright eyes

I fеlt every emotion
I was losing control, was hitting a wall
So out of focus (Mm)
I don’t wanna stay broken
I gotta be free, got lightning in me

I felt blind for way too long
But now I’ve got

Bright eyes, look at me now, you better believe it
Oh my, I'm feeling so high, I'm touching the ceiling
Bright eyes, I'm finally here, I finally see that
I don’t wanna live without these, I don't wanna live without
Bright eyes, look at me now, you better believe it
Oh my, I'm feeling so high, I'm touching the ceiling
Bright eyes, I'm finally here, I finally see that
I don't wanna live without these, I don't wanna live without

Yeah, I'm not mad, I did all the work
No longer sad, I'm putting me first
Out with the past, it no longer hurts
It no longer burns, it no longer works
Yeah, I'm not mad, I did all the work
No longer sad, I'm putting me first
Out with the past, it no longer hurts
It no longer burns, it no longer works
Yeah, I'm not mad, I did all the work
No longer sad, I'm putting me first
Out with the past, it no longer hurts

Bright eyes, look at me now, you better believe it
Oh my, I'm feeling so high, I'm touching the ceiling
Bright eyes, I'm finally here, I finally see that
I don't wanna live without these, I don't wanna live without
Bright eyes, look at me now, you better believe it
Oh my, I'm feeling so high, I'm touching the ceiling
Bright eyes, I'm finally here, I finally see that
I don't wanna live without these, I don't wanna live without
