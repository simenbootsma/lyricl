Enola Gay - Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark

Enola Gay
You should have stayed at home yesterday
Ah-ha, words can't describe
The feeling and the way you lied
These games you play
They're gonna end in more than tears someday
Ah-ha, Enola Gay
It shouldn't ever have to end this way

It's 8:15
And that's the time that it's always been
We got your message on the radio
Conditions normal and you're coming home


Enola Gay
Is mother proud of
Little Boy
today?
Ah-ha, this kiss
you give
It's never ever gonna fade away

Enola Gay
It shouldn't ever have to end this way
Ah-ha, Enola Gay
It shouldn't fade our dreams away

It's 8:15
And that's the time that it's always been
We got your message on the radio
Conditions normal and you're coming home

Enola Gay
Is mother proud of Little Boy
today?
Ah-ha, this kiss you give
It's never ever gonna fade away
