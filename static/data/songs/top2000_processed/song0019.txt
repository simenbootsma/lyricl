Child In Time  - Deep Purple


Sweet child, in time, you'll see the line
The line that's drawn between good and bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying, oh, taking toll
If you've been bad, Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit, oh, by a flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
Oh
, bow your head
Wait for the ricochet

Ooh

Oh, I wanna hear you sing

Sweet child, in time, you'll see the line
The line that's drawn between good and bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying, mmm, taking toll
If you've been bad, Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit, oh, by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
Oh
, bow your head
Wait for the ricochet
