Sultans Of Swing - Dire Straits

You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river, you stop
And you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie,
double-four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain
To hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they're blowing that sound

Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

You check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
They've said an old guitar is all he can afford

And Harry doesn't mind
If he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job
He's doing alright
He can play the honky-tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night

With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing
Yeah

And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll

And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole


And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
“Goodnight, now it's time to go home”
Then he makes it fast with one more thing

“We are the Sultans
We are the Sultans of Swing”
