Slow Dancing In A Burning Room - John Mayer

It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dyin' breath of
This love that we've been workin' on
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's gonna come and save ya
We pulled too many false alarms

We're goin' down
And you can see it too
We're goin' down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancin' in a burnin' room

I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothin' to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch, because you can
You'll try to hit me, just to hurt me
So you leave me feelin' dirty

We're goin' down
And you can see it, too
We're goin' down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancin' in a burnin' room

Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?

My dear, we're slow dancin' in a burnin' room

Burnin' room
Burnin' room
Burnin' room
Burnin' room

Don't you think we oughta know by now?
Don't you think we shoulda learned somehow?
Don't you think we oughta know by now?
Don't you think we shoulda learned somehow?
Don't you think we oughta know by now?
Don't you think we shoulda learned somehow?
