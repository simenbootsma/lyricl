Home - Dotan

Run past the rivers, run past all the light
Feel it crashing and burning, 'til it all collides
Strike a match, lit the fire, shining up the sky
As it all comes down again
As it all comes down again
As it all comes down again to the sound

The sound of the wind is whispering in your head
Can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running 'til we're there
We're coming home now, we're coming home now
The sound of the wind is whispering in your head
Can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running 'til we're there
We're coming home now, we're coming home now

Hear the voices around us, hear them screaming out
We'll be crying for mercy, we'll be crying out loud
Burn the bridges in our town 'til the point where we drown
As it all comes down again
As it all comes down again

The sound of the wind is whispering in your head
Can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running 'til we're there
We're coming home now, we're coming home now
The sound of the wind is whispering in your head
Can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running 'til we're there
We're coming home now, we're coming home now

We are coming home, we are coming home
We are coming home, we are coming home
We are coming home, we are coming home
We are coming home, we are coming home
We are coming home, we are coming home
We are coming home, we are coming home
We are coming home, we are coming home
We are coming home, we are coming home
We are coming home, we are coming home
(The sound of the wind is whispering in your head)
We are coming home, we are coming home
(Can you feel it coming back?)
We are coming home, we are coming home
(Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running 'til we're there)
We are coming home, we are coming home
(We're coming home now, we're coming home now)

The sound of the wind is whispering in your head
Can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running 'til we're there
We're coming home now, we're coming home now
The sound of the wind is whispering in your head
Can you feel it coming back?
Through the warmth, through the cold, keep running 'til we're there
We're coming home now, we're coming home now
