Smokers Outside The Hospital Doors - Editors

Pull the blindfold down so your eyes can't see
Now run as fast as you can through this field of trees

Say goodbye to everyone you have ever known
You are not gonna see them ever again

I can't shake this feeling I've got
My dirty hands, have I been in the wars?
The saddest thing that I'd ever seen were smokers outside the hospital doors

Someone turn me around
Can I start this again?

How can we wear our smiles with our mouths wired shut
'Cause you stopped us from singing?

I can't shake this feeling I've got
My dirty hands, have I been in the wars?

Someone turn me around
Can I start this again?
Now someone turn us around
Can we start this again?

We've all been changed from what we were
Our broken hearts left smashed on the floor
I can't believe you if I can't hear you
I can't believe you if I can't hear you
(We've all been changed from what we were
Our broken hearts smashed on the floor
We've all been changed from what we were
Our broken hearts smashed on the floor)

Someone turn me around (We've all been changed from what we were)
Can I start this again? (Our broken hearts smashed on the floor)
Now someone turn us around (We've all been changed from what we were)
Can we start this again? (Our broken hearts smashed on the floor)
