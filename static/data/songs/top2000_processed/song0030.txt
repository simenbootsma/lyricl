I was caught in the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round and I knew there was no turnin' back (Thunder)
My mind raced and I thought, "What could I do?" (Thunder)
And I knew there was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums beatin' in my heart

You've been
Thunderstruck

Went down the highway,
broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls, some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

And I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again, please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

You've been
Thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah

I was shakin' at the knees


Ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, yeah

We're doin' fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doin' fine, so fine
