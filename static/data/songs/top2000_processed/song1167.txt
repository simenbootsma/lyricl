You're The Voice - John Farnham

We have the chance to turn the pages over
We can write what we want to write
We gotta make ends meet before we get much older

We're all someone's daughter
We're all someone's son
How long can we look at each other
Down the barrel of a gun?

You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear, oh, woah
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah

This time, we know we all can stand together
With the power to be powerful
Believing we can make it better

Ooh, we're all someone's daughter
We're all someone's son, oh
How long can we look at each other

You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear, oh, woah
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah

Ooh, we're all someone's daughter
We're all someone's son
How long can we look at each other
Down the barrel of a gun?

You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear, oh, woah
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah
You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear, oh, woah
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah
You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear, oh, woah
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah
You're the voice, try and understand it
Make a noise and make it clear, oh, woah
We're not gonna sit in silence
We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah
