Going To The Run - Golden Earring
I could bet on new years eve
He'd call me up at night
From the other side of the world
Ed was always there alright
Ed's got the looks of a movie star
Ed's got the smile of a prince
He ride a bike instead of a car
I want to be his friend
Dancing in the living room
With the ladies so nice
Like a child with a wisdom tooth
He's just a friend of mine
Ed's got the rings and the colors
Ed's got the wind in his hair
He goes a riding with the brothers
He's got a fist in the air
Going to the run, run Angel
Going to the run, run Angel
Well, heaven and hell came together that night
Only for you this time
Going to the run, forever Angel
One summer at the festival
Holding on real tight
On the back of a Harley
He took me for a ride in the sky
Ed's got the looks of a movie star
Ed's got the smile of a prince
He'd ride a bike instead of a car
I'll always be his friendGoing to the run, run Angel
Going to the run, run Angel
And his wings started to shine so bright
Like a fire in the night
Going to the run, forever Angel
Going to the run, run Angel
Forever going to the run, run Angel
Well, heaven and hell came together that night
Only for you this time
Going to the run, forever Angel
