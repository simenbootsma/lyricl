Never Be Clever - Herman Brood & His Wild Romance
Going down the line, my head up high
Wonder why it's so hard to feel fine
Got all I need
Plastic teeth
A pocket full of speed
And I'm cool with the heat
I got a groovy little lady
Seems I'm waisting her time
Got a hit and a bullet
Still back in crime
People say I used to do better
Si I guess I'm gonna have to get myself together

But I'll never
Ooh aah aah
I'll never be clever
I'll never be clever
Ooh aah aah
I'll never be clever
Some say I'm suicidal
With a sense of humour
Some say I'm faking it all
Trying to start rumours
Some people say a moment lasts longer
I find myself at home
Settled down, write a song
I'll love to hang around
In black people's places
Fascinated staring at faces
Holy mama, make me concentrate
Got to write a song
And I got to createGoing down the line, my head up high enz
