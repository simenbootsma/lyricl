Unfinished Sympathy - Massive Attack

I know that I've imagined love before
And how it could be with you

Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby
How can you have a day without a night?
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more, yeah

The curiousness of your potential kiss
Has got my mind and body aching

Really hurt me, baby, really cut me, baby
How can you have a day without a night?
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've got to know much more

Hey, hey...
Hey, hey, hey...
Hey, hey, hey...

Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Hey! I...
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
I, I, I, I, I...
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part (Are you ready?)
Like a soul without a mind
In a body without a heart
I'm missing every part
Hey, hey...
Are you ready?
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Hey...
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Hey...Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Hey...

I don't know where this one came from... (Are you ready?)
I don't know where this one came from...
I don't know where this–, I don't know where this–
Idon't know where this–, I don't know where this–"
I don't know where this one came from...
