I'll Take Care Of You  - Beth Hart & Joe Bonamassa

I know you've been hurt
By someone else
I can tell by the way
You carry yourself

But if you'll let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you

I, I loved and lost
The same as you
So you see I know
Just what you've been through

And if you'll let me
Here's what I'll do
I just have got to take care of you

You won't ever have to worry
You don't ever have to cry
I'll be there beside you
To dry your weeping eyes
So darlin' tell me
That you'll be true
'Cause there's no doubt in my mind
I know what I want to do
And just as sure

I just got, I got to take care of you
I just got to take care of you
Take care of you
