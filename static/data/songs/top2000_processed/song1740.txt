Riptide - Vance Joy

I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turnin' green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Oh-ooh, oh-oh
And they come unstuck

Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's runnin' from himself
And she's been livin' on the highest shelf

Oh-ooh, oh-oh

Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you, when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady, runnin' down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singin' that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong, yeah
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
