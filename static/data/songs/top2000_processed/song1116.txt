Spread Your Wings - Queen

Sammy was low, just watchin' the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him, "Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweepin' up the Emerald Bar"

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together 'cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keepin' his thoughts to himself
He'd be leaving soon
Wishin' he was miles and miles away
Nothin' in this world, nothin' would make him stay

Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothin' came easy to him
Now it was time, he'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him, "Now listen, boy! You're always dreamin'
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?

So honey, spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together 'cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

Come on, honey
Fly with me
