Nobody's Wife - Anouk

I'm sorry for the times that I made you scream
For the times that I killed your dreams
For the times that I made your whole world rumble
For the times that I made you cry
For the times that I told you lies
For the times that I watched and let you stumble

It's too bad, but that's me
What goes around comes around, and you'll see
That I can carry the burden of pain
'Cause it ain't the first time that a man goes insane
And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life
Suckin' out his love, I, I'll never be nobody's wife

I'm sorry for the times that I didn't come home
Left you lyin' in that bed alone
Was flyin' high in the sky when you needed my shoulder
Like a stone hangin' round my neck, see
Cut it loose before it breaks my back, see
I've gotta say what I feel before I grow older
I'm sorry but I ain't gonna change my ways
You know I've tried but I'm still the same

It's too bad, but hey, that's me
What goes around comes around, you'll see
That I can carry the burden of pain
'Cause it ain't the first time, no, that a man goes insane
And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life
Suckin' out his love, I, I'll never be nobody's wife


It's too bad, but hey, that's me
What goes around comes around, and you'll see
That I can carry the burden of pain
'Cause it ain't the first time, oh no
That a man goes insane
'Cause when I spread my wings to embrace him for life
Suckin' out his love
I'll never be nobody's wife
I'll never be, never be
Never gonna be
Never gonna be
Never gonna be nobody's wife
Nobody, nobody, no, no
I'll never be, never gonna be
