Gimme All Your Lovin'  - ZZ Top

I got to have a shot
For what you got is, oh, so sweet
You got to make it hot
Like a boomerang, I need a repeat

Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through

You got to whip it up
And hit me like a ton of lead
If I blow my top
Will you let it go to your head?

Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through

You got to move it up
And work it like a schoolboy would
Got to pack it up
Baby, work it like a new boy should

Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through
