Plush - Stone Temple Pilots

And I feel that time's a wasted go
So where you goin' till tomorrow?
And I see that these are lies to come
So would you even care?

And I feel it
And I feel it

Where you goin' for tomorrow?
Where you goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

And I feel so much depends on the weather
So is it rainin' in your bedroom?
And I see that these are the eyes of disarray
So would you even care?

And I feel it

Where you goin' for tomorrow?
Where you goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it


Where you goin' for tomorrow?
Where you goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time to wait for tomorrow

To find it
To find it
To find it
