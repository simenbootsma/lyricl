Motorcycle Emptiness - Manic Street Preachers

Culture sucks down words
Itemise loathing and feed yourself smiles
Organise your safe tribal war
Hurt, maim, kill, and enslave the ghetto
Each day living out a lie
Life sold cheaply forever, ever, ever

Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness

Life lies a slow suicide
Orthodox dreams and symbolic myths
From feudal serf to spender
This wonderful world of purchase power
Just like lungs sucking on air
Survival's natural as sorrow, sorrow, sorrow

Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness

All we want from you are the kicks you’ve given us
All we want from you are the kicks you’ve given us
All we want from you are the kicks you’ve given us
All we want from you are the kicks you’ve given us

Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness

Drive away and it's the same
Everywhere death row, everyone's a victim
Your joys are counterfeit
This happiness, corrupt political shit
Living life like a comatose
Ego, loaded and swallow, swallow, swallow

Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness
Motorcycle emptiness
Under neon loneliness
Everlasting nothingness
