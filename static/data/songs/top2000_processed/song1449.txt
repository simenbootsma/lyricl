Virtual Insanity - Jamiroquai

Oh yeah, aw
What we're livin' in?
Let me tell ya

Yeah, it's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doin' for us?
And I'm givin' all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothin's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take, but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Woah, it's a crazy world we're livin' in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these

Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless twisting of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound

And I'm thinkin', what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man
has made
And now every mother can choose the colour
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well, that's what they said yesterday
There's nothin' left to do but pray
I think it's time to find a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these futures that we have to be told

Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless twisting of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground, whoa!

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothin' so bad
As a man-made' man

I know I can't go on
Of this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change, yeah
Things will never be the same
And I can't go on
Where we're living in
Oh, oh, virtual insanity
Oh, this world
Has got to change
'Cause I just
I just can't keep going on in this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in
And that virtual insanity is what is, yeah

Oooooooh...

Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless twisting of our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground
Futures made of, now, virtual insanity
Now we all, we seem to be governed by a love
For these useless twisting of our new technology
And now there is no sound, for we all live underground

Oh, now this life that we live in
(Virtual insanity
)
It's all goin' wrong
Out of window (living in), you know
There is nothing worse than a meddling
man
(Virtual insanity)
There is nothing worse than (living in) a foolish man
(Virtual insanity) Hey!
Virtual insanity is what we're livin' in, yeah
Well...it's alright
