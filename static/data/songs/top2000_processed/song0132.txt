Multicolor - Son Mieux

Waking tonight from a dream black and white
To a life in multicolor
Polarized lights, flash and open my eyes
To a world that's undiscovered

I see you, I see me
Like a lost memory
That's appearing out of the blue
All is new, that I see
Now I truly perceive
There is more than I ever knew

In this view
I see all the colors in you
In this view
I see all the colors in you

The rhythm of the street looks like music to me
It's a sound that I ain't ever seen before
Had to hear it to receive it
Had to see it to believe it

I see you, I see me
Like a lost memory
That's appearing out of the blue
All is new, that I see
Now I truly perceive
There is more than I ever knew

In this view
I see all the colors in you
In this view
I see all the colors in you
Multicolor
Multicolor
Multicolor
I see all the colors in you

Watching as the night turns to morning
The temporary tones of the sky
Remind me that we're always evolving
Nothing's ever black and white
So it's you and I, and it's all
Multicolor
Multicolor

In this view
I see all the colors in you
In this view
I see all the colors in you
Multicolor
Multicolor
Multicolor
I see all the colors in you
Multicolor
