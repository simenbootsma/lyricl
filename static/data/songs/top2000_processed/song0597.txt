Snow  - Red Hot Chili Peppers

Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come, get to play it up
All my life to sacrifice

Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh-oh
I got your hey, oh
Now listen what I say, oh-oh (Oh)

When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more, time to decide on
When it's killin' me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside?
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killin' me, what do I really need

Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh-oh
Come back and hey, oh
Look at what I say, oh-oh (Oh)

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey, oh, wo-oh-oh-oh-wo

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so
white as snow
Runnin' through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go,
ho!

Went to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come, get to play it up

Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh-oh
I got your hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh-oh

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey, oh, wo-oh-oh-oh-wo

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so
white as snow
Runnin' through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's no
where to go

I said, hey, hey, yeah, ah, yeah
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell my love now
Hey, hey, yeah, ah, yeah
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Runnin' through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go (Woo)

I said, hey, ah, yeah, ah, yeah
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell my love now
Hey, ye-yeah, oh, yeah
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
