Sweet Child O' Mine  - Guns N' Roses


She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine


She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide

Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

Ooh!

Oh, oh-oh-yeah
Woah, yeah
Woah, oh, h-o
Sweet child of mine
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Sweet love of mine
Woah, oh-oh-oh
Sweet child of mine, ooh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Sweet love of mine

Ooh, where do we go now? (Where do we go?)
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-oh, wow

Oh-oh, where do we go now?
(Oh) Where do we go, oh-oh-oh-oh? (Oh, wow)
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Woah-oh, where do we go now?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Sweet child
