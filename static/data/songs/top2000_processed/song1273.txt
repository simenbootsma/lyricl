Road To Nowhere - Talking Heads

Well, we know where we're goin'
But we don't know where we've been
And we know what we're knowin'
But we can't say what we've seen
And we're not little children
And we know what we want
And the future is certain
Give us time to work it out
Yeah

We're on a road to nowhere
Come on inside
Takin' that ride to nowhere
We'll take that ride
I'm feeling okay this morning
And you know
We're on the road to paradise
Here we go, here we go

We're on a ride to nowhere
Come on inside
Takin' that ride to nowhere
We'll take that ride
Maybe you wonder where you are
I don't care
Here is where time is on our side

We're on a road to nowhere (Ha! Ha!)
We're on a road to nowhere (Ha! Ha!)
We're on a road to nowhere (Ha! Ha! Woo!)

There's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
And it's very far away
But it's growin' day by day
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
Would you like to come along?
You can help me sing the song
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
They can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
There's a city in my mind
Come along and take that ride
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
And it's very far away
But it's growin' day by day
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
Would you like to come along?
You can help me sing the song
And it's all right, baby, it's all right
They can tell you what to do
But they'll make a fool of you

We're on a road to nowhere (Hey!)
We're on a road to nowhere (Hey!)
We're on a road to nowhere (Hey! Hey!)
We're on a road to nowhere
