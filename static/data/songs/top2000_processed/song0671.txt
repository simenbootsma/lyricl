Holding Back The Years - Simply Red

Holding back the years
Thinking of the fear I've had so long
When somebody hears
Listen to the fear that's gone

Strangled by the wishes of pater
Hoping for the arms of mater
Get to me the sooner or later, oh

Holding back the years
Chance for me escape from all I've known
Holding back the tears
'Cause nothing here has grown

I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
Nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could yeah, oh well

I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on

Alright
Oh, now
Well, I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all of those years
And nothing had the chance to be good
'Cause nothing ever could, oh, yeah
Oh

I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
Holding, holding, holding

Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la
I say, ooh, well
That's all I have today
It's all I have to say
