Storm And Thunder - Earth & Fire
Darkness of the night has gone
A blackbird sings a song at dawn
Crystal drops of morning dew
Are covering all the grass
The landscape wears its morning dress
The foliage of the wood shines bright
As green as emerald's light
Over the fields vibrating air
Causes a faintly glance
Some cows are grazing near a fence
While lowering clouds accumulate
Midges dancing above the lake
The haymakers, they go away
Hiding for a storm
A flash of lightening struck
Storm and thunder
Beat the nature
Down gushes the rain
And wind cracks the trees
