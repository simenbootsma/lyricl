Walk Of Life - Dire Straits

Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo

Here come Johnny singing oldies, goldies
"Be-Bop-A-Lula,"
baby, "What'd I Say"
Here come Johnny singing "I Got a Woman"
Down in the tunnels, tryna make it pay

He got the action, he got the motion
Oh, yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
He turnin' all the night-time into the day

He do the song about the sweet loving woman
He do the song about the knife
Then he do the walk, do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life
Woo-hoo

Here come Johnny gonna tell you the story
Hand me down, my walking shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory

He got the action, he got the motion
Oh, yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
He turning all the night-time into the day

He do the song about the sweet loving woman
He do the song about the knife
And he do the walk, he do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life
Woo-hoo-hoo

Here come Johnny singing oldies, goldies
"Be-Bop-A-Lula,"
baby, "What'd I Say"
Here come Johnny singing "I Got a Woman"
Down in the tunnels, tryna make it pay

He got the action, he got the motion
Oh, yeah, the boy can play
The dedication, devotion
He turning all the night-time into the day

And after all the violence and double-talk
There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, yeah, you do the walk of life

Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Yeah, he do the walk of life
