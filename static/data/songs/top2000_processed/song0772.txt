Human - Rag'n'Bone Man

I'm only human
I'm only, I'm only
I'm only human
Human (Human)

Maybe I'm foolis
Maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this
And see what's behind
Got no way to prove it
So maybe I'm lying

But I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put your blame on me (Oh-oh)

Take a look in the mirror
And what do you see?
Do you see it clearer
Or are you deceived

'Cause I'm only human after all
You're only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

(Oh-oh) Some people got the real problems
(Oh-oh) Some people out of luck
(Oh-oh) Some people think I can solve them
(Oh-oh) Lord heavens above (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me (Oh-oh)
Don't put the blame on me (Oh-oh)

Don't ask my opinion
Don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness
For making you cry
Making you cry

'Cause I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me

(Oh-oh) Oh, some people got the real problems
(Oh-oh) Some people out of luck
(Oh-oh) Some people think I can solve them
(Oh-oh) Lord heavens above (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me (Oh-oh)
Don't put the blame on me (Oh-oh)

(Oh-oh-oh)
I'm only human, I make mistakes
I'm only human, that's all it takes
To put the blame on me (Oh-oh)
Don't put the blame on me (Oh-oh)

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause I'm no prophet or Messiah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You should go looking somewhere higher

I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me

I'm only human, I do what I can
I'm just a man, I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me
