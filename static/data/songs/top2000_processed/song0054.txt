Creep - Radiohead

When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather in a beautiful world
I wish I was special
, you're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice when I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special, I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
Oh-oh, oh-oh

She's runnin' out the door
She's runnin' out
She run, run, run, run

Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special, I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
