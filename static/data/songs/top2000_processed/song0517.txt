Cowboys And Angels  - George Michael

When your heart's in someone else's hands
Monkey see and monkey do, their wish is your command
You're not to blame, everyone's the same
All you do is love and love is all you do
I should know by now the way I fought for you
You're not to blame, everyone's the same

I know you think that you're safe, mister
Harmless deception that keeps love at bay
It's the ones who resist that we most want to kiss
Wouldn't you say?

Cowboys and angels, they all have the time for you
Why should I imagine that I'd be a find for you?
Why should I imagine that I'd have something to say?
But that scar on your face, that beautiful face of yours
In your heart, there's a trace of someone before

When your heart's in someone else's plans
Things you say and things you do, that they don't understand
It's such a shame, always ends the same
You can call it love but I don't think it's true
You should know by now, I'm not the boy for you

I know you think that you're safe, sister
Harmless affection that keeps things this way
It's the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss
Who will pay

Cowboys and angels, they all take a shine to you
Why should I imagine that I was designed for you?
Why should I believe that you would stay?
That scar on your face, that beautiful face of yours
Don't you think that I'd know they've hurt you, before?

Take this man to your bed
Maybe his hands will help you forget
Please be stronger than your past
The future may still give you a chance
