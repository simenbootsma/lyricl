It's A Long Way There  - Little River Band
Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something
People on their own are getting nowhere
I'm on the road to see
If anything is anywhere or waiting, just for me
Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
That feeling of being together when I go
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
Hey, everybody, don't you feel that there's something
But you know in a moment it is gone
I live for the day when I can hear people saying
That they know and they care for everyone
But I feel like I've been here for the whole of my life
Never knowing home
It's a long way, it's a long, long, long way there
I'm gonna keep on tryin', I'm gonna keep on tryin', yeah
I'm gonna keep on tryin', keep on tryin'Been away from home for such a long time
And got to know this town
But I don't seem to matter much to anyone who's around
Is there anybody around
Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
The feeling of being together when I go
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
Everybody knows it's a long way there
Oh, everybody knows it's a long way there
Mmm, it's a long way
Driving around's kind of getting me down and I know, and I know
It's a long long way there
It's such a long long way, long way
Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something
Feel it, feel it
Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something
