Driver's Seat - Sniff 'n The Tears
Doing all right
A little jiving
on a Saturday night
And come what may
Gonna dance the day away
Jenny was sweet
She always smiled for the people she'd meet
On trouble and strife
She had another way of looking at life
The news is blue (the news is blue)
It has its own way to get to you (ooh)
What can I do? (what can I do?)
I'll never remember my time with you
Pick up your feet
Got to move to the trick of the beat
There is no elite
Just take your place in the driver's seat
Driver's seat, ooh
Driver's seat, yeah

And come what may (ooh)
Gonna dance the day away (yeah)Driver's seat, ooh
