Plug In Baby - Muse

I've exposed your lies, baby
The underneath's no big surprise
Now it's time for changing
And cleansing everything
To forget your love

My plug-in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, woah-oh-oh
My plug-in baby
In unbroken virgin realities
Is tired of living, ooh

Don't confuse, baby you're gonna lose
Your own game
Change me
And replace the envying
To forget your love

And my plug-in baby
Crucifies my enemies
When I'm tired of giving, woah-oh-oh
My plug-in baby
In unbroken virgin realities

And I've seen your loving
Mine is gone
And I've been in trouble
Wooaahhh
