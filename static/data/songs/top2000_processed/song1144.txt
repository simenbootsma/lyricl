Scarlet Ribbons - The Cats
I peeked in to say goodnight
When I heard my child in prayer
"And for me, some scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair"
All our stores were closed and shuttered
All the streets were dark en bare
In our town, no scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair
Through the night my heart was aching
Just before the dawn was breaking
In our town, no scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair
I peeked in and on her bed
In gay profusion lying there
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair
If I live to be a hundred
I will never know from where
Came those lovely scerlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair
