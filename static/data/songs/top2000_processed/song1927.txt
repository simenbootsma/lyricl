Isn't It Time - The Babys

Falling in love was the last thing I had on my mind
Holding you is a warmth that I thought I could never find

(Sitting here all alone) Just trying to decide
(Whether to go all alone) Or stay by your side
(Then I stop myself because) I know I could cry
I just can't find the answers to the questions
That keep going through my mind
Hey, babe, isn't it time?

(Isn't it time? it took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)
Isn't it time?
(Isn't it time? you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)

I've seen visions of someone like you in my life
A love that's strong, reaching out
Holding me through the darkest night

(Sitting here all alone) Just trying to decide
(Whether to go all alone) Or stay by your side
(Then I stop myself because) I don't want to cry
I just can't find the answers to the questions
That keep going through my mind

(Isn't it time? it took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)
Isn't it time?
(Isn't it time? you took time to wait)
(Falling in love could be your mistake)

I feel a warmth in my heart and my soul that I never knew
This love affair gives me strength that I need
Just to get me through

(Sitting here all alone) Just wondering why
(Gonna stop myself because) I know I could cry
(Then I think of you) And everything seems alright
I've finally found the answers to the questions
That keep going through my mind
Hey, babe, isn't it time?
