Money  - Pink Floyd

*clinking coins, a ringing cash register, tearing paper, a clicking counting machine and other items in a rhythmic pattern*

Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay, and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash

New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team
*clinking noises continue*

Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Ah, don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit

I'm in the hi-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Learjet


Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today

But if you ask for a rise
It's no surprise that they're giving none away

Away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Ooh
Away, ooh
Ooh, ooh
No, no, no
Wooh, wooh-ooh-ooh
No, no, no
Bah, bah, bah
Wah-bah-bah-woo-hoo-wa-hoo
Do-da-wa
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-da-do
Woo

"Yeah, (*laughter*) I was in the right"
"Yes, absolutely in the right"
"I certainly was in the right"
"Yeah, I was definitely in the right; that geezer was cruising for a bruising"
"Yeah!"
"Why does anyone do anything?"
"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time"
"I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter outâ€¦"
