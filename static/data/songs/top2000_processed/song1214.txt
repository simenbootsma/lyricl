Something Just Like This - The Chainsmokers & Coldplay

I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control and Batman with his fists
And clearly, I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, "Where d'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk?"
I'm not lookin' for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this


I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
The testaments they told, the moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls a suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, "Where d'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk?"
I'm not lookin' for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can miss

I want something just like this
I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Where d'you wanna go? How much you wanna risk?
I'm not lookin' for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss

Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
