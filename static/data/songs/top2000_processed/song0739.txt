Sweet Sounds Of Heaven  - The Rolling Stones ft. Lady Gaga & Stevie Wonder


I hear the sweet, sweet sounds of Heaven
Fallin' down, fallin' down to this earth
I hear the sweet, sweetest sounds of Heaven
Driftin' down, driftin' down to this earth

Bless the Father, bless the Son
Hear the sound of the drums
As it echoes through the valley
And it bursts, yeah
Let no woman or child
Go hungry tonight
Please protect us from the pain
And the hurt, yeah

I smell the sweet scents, sweet
Sweet scents of Heaven, Heaven
Tumblin' down, tumblin' down
Tumblin' down to the earth (Oh)
I hear the sweet sounds, sweet sounds
The sweet sounds, ooh, the sweet sounds of children
And they're praisin', praisin'

No, I'm not, not goin' to Hell
In some dusty motel
And I'm not, not goin' down
In the dirt (Yes, yes, yes)
I'm gonna laugh, I'm gonna laugh, I'm gonna cry, I'm gonna cry
Eat the bread, drink the wine
'Cause I'm finally, finally quenchin'
My thirst, yeah

You can't have a light without a little shadow, yeah
Always need a target for your bow and arrow
I want to be drenched in the rain of your heavenly love
Oh, yeah, c'mon (Oh)

Let the music, let the music play loud, play loud
Let it burst, let it burst through the clouds, through the clouds
And we all feel the heat
Of the sun, yeah
Yeah, let us sing, let us shout, let us shout
Let us all stand up proud
Let the old still believe

Sweet, sweet sound

Sounds so sweet, oh, so sweet
Sounds so sweet, so sweet
Heaven, heaven
Down
Fallin' down, fallin' down
To this earth


I hear the sweet sounds of Heaven
Play me something, Stevie

I smell the sweet, sweet scents of Heaven
Comin' down (Comin' down), comin' down (Comin' down)
To the earth (From the earth)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Yes, c'mon
Ooh, c'mon
C'mon, ooh, c'mon

Hear the gods laughin' from above
Of Heaven
Fallin' down, fallin' down
To this earth, oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me lay down and sleep
Oh, oh, Heaven, Heaven
Ooh, ooh, ooh
