Remedy - The Black Crowes

Baby, baby, why can't you sit still?
Who killed that bird out on your windowsill?
Are you the reason that it broke its back?
Tell me, did I see you, baby, laugh about that?

If I come on like a dream (Dream)
Will you let me show you what I mean? (What I mean?)
Will you let me come on inside? (Inside)
Ooh, will you let it glide?

Can I have some remedy? (All I want is a remedy)
Remedy for me, please (For all of the things that I need)
If I had some remedy (Ooh, I would take enough)
I'd take enough to please me (Please me)

Baby, baby, why you dye your hair?
Why you always keepin' with your mother's dare?
So baby, why? Who's who? Who, babe? I know you too
Tell me, did the other children scold on you?

If I come on like a dream (Dream)
Ooh, will you let me show you what I mean? (What I mean?)
Will you let me come on inside? (Inside)

Can I have some remedy? (All I want is a remedy)
Remedy for me, please (For all of the things I need, need)
If I had some remedy (I would surely take enough)
I'd take enough to please me (To please me)

Woo!

Uh, I need a remedy, huh, yeah
For what is ailin' me, ya see? Huh
I need a remedy
For what is ailin' a-me
I need a remedy, yeah
For what's ailin' me
Wow, if I only had a remedy
You see, I'd find it (If I had some remedy, find it)
You see, baby, I want it (I want it)
Ooh, you see, I'd find it (I'd take enough to please me, find it)
Ooh, I really want, I really want it
You see, I need it (If I had some remedy)
Oh, I really wanna tell you all about it
Yeah, I wanna scream it, scream it (I'd take enough to please me)
Ooh, I feel I just wanna shout about it ('Bout it)
I need a remedy, remedy, remedy, remedy, remedy (If I had some remedy)
Remedy, remedy, remedy, yeah

Wow, I see it
Oh, no, no, no
