Why Tell Me Why - Anita Meyer
When I was young, I felt the need of learnin', learnin'
Love, I was told kept the wheel on turnin', turnin'
Still I'm tryin' to find, peace of mine inside
Once in your life, you feel the urge of knowin', knowin'
And wonderin' why
Come on people, better use our sense, our time is runnin' out
There ain't no doubt about
We can make it, try to rearrange it if there's a price we got
To toss the dice
Oh! (Won't you tell me what's right!)
Oh, yeah! (Won't you tell me what's wrong!)
Oh! Won't you tell me what's right! Somebody tell me now!
Believe in Destiny, believe in Humanity, believe in we'll meet again
Somehow, somewhere, someday (this feelin', this mess will never end)
Why? Tell me why? Tell me why? Tell me why do I pray?
I need to know right now, oh!
Why? Tell me why? Tell me why? Tell me why do I pray?
I hope that freedom soon will come our way
Why? Tell me why?
Come on people, lent a helpin' hand, no need to fuss
And fight we all know where we stand
Help me make it, try to rearrange it
Name your price and I will toss the diceOh! (Won't you tell me what's right!)
Oh, yeah! (Won't you tell me what's wrong!)
Oh! Won't you tell me what's right! Somebody tell me now!
Believe in Destiny, believe in Humanity, believe in we'll meet again
Somehow, somewhere, someday (this feelin', this mess will never end)
Why? Tell me why? Tell me why? Tell me why do I pray?
I need to know right now, oh!
Why? Tell me why? Tell me why? Tell me why do I pray?
I hope that freedom soon will come our way
Why? Tell me why? Tell me why? Tell me why do I pray?
I need a key to help me any way
Why? Tell me why? Tell me why? Tell me why do I pray?
