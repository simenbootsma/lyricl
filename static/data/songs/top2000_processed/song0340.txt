Basket Case - Green Day

Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothin' and everything all at once?
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringin' me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit my whinin' 'cause it's bringin' her down

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Uh-yuh-yuh-yuh

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?
