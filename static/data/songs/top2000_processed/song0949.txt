She Flies On Strange Wings - Golden Earring
Lonely is the night without you
Just as lonely as the shepherd without sheep
And where flies the falcon in the high sweet air
Without hunting his prey in valleys deep?
She wears softness as a gown
She spreads magic all around
Her feathers still untouched
She takes but nothing and she gives so much
She flies on strange wings
She flies on strange winds
She brings strange things
She flies on strange wings
She takes off when she desires
Silence grows on her lips
She can bring you so much higher
She spreads love on all her trips, yeah
Woke up this morning
And this feeling came to my head
To fly with her from sky to sky
'Cause my mind seemed to be dead
So I floated up towards her
On my mutilated wings
But all the blackness sings against me now
It's the lady of the strange wingsShe wears softness as a gown
She spreads magic all around
Her feathers still untouched
She takes but nothing and she gives so much
