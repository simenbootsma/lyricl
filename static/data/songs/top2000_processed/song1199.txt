Girl - Anouk

Girl, girl, girl, when I hear him talk
Ooh, my mind gets blocked, girl
Speak up 'cause my jaw is locked
Which is good, good for me, girl
It hides like a warning sign
But I'm too blind to see

Speak up, yes, I'm coming down
With an ice cold fever
Ice cold fever, ice cold fever
Still got my hands, they're clinging
So I just keep going

I don't know where I belong
Could I belong to you?
No, I don't know where I belong
Could I belong?

Girl, girl, girl, get it while it's hot they say
You see I'm burning up here
I want to but I just can't stop
And it hurts, it hurts like hell, girl

Ooh, you got me head over heels, I'm stuck
Yes, I'm coming down with an ice cold fever
Ice cold fever, ice cold fever, aha
Still got my hands, they're clinging
So I just keep going

I don't know where I belong
Could I belong to you?
No I don't know where I belong
Could I belong?
Could I belong?

Still got my hands, they're clinging
So I just keep going

I don't know where I belong
Could I belong to you?
No, I don't know where I belong
Could I belong?
Oh, girl, could I belong
To you, you, you?
To you, yeah you
To you, you, you
To you, yeah, you
To you, you, you
Yeah, I belong to you
Say you, yeah, you
Could I belong to you?
Alright, hey, hey, hey
Oh, good
