As - George Michael & Mary J. Blige

Do do do do, whoa whoa whoa
Do do do do

As around the Sun the Earth knows
She's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's a cure
You can rest your mind assured
That I'll be lovin' you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be lovin' you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Always)
Until the day that is the day that I'm no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
That last through forever
Another day
As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Couldn't make me be the past
But that I mustn't fear
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I left behind

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
(Now ain't that lovin' you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(I'll be lovin' you forever)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that I'm no more

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
(True love don't want a thing)
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever
Another day
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
And I'll be loving you always

Lovin' you until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Lovin' you until the ocean covers every mountain high
Lovin' you until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Lovin' you until the dream of life and life becomes a dream
(Now ain't that lovin' you, yeah yeah)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
(Now ain't that lovin' you, yeah)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(I'll be loving you forever)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
(I'll be loving, loving, check this out)

Always
Always
Always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Always
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until the dream of life and life becomes a dream
Check this out
Always
Always
Always
I'll be love, love, yeah
Always
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Parrots live at sea
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more
