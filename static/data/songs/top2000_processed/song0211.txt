Saturday Night - Herman Brood & His Wild Romance
The neon light of the "Open all night"
Was just in time replaced by the magic appearance of a new day
While a melancholic Reno was crawling on his back
Just in front of the supermarket doorway, child
Hey girl, on a cold summer night
As we stood on the corner
As a man passed by and asked us
What we were doing, what we need
As he pointed his big fat finger
To the people hanging round at the corner of the
Other side of street
Oh well
Doing nothing, just hanging around
What do you mean doing nothing Sir
So we had to hit him to the ground
Doing nothing, just hanging around
His head all busted looking just a little to wise, child

I just can't wait
I just can't wait
For Saturday night
For Saturday night
For Saturday night

Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night

I just can't wait
I just can't wait
Saturday night
