Ashes To Ashes - David Bowie


Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song?
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh, no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following"

The shrieking of nothing is killing
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing

Ashes to ash and funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high


Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh, no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light
, but no smoking pistol

I've never done good things
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue
, whoa whoa
I never did anything out of the blue, whoa whoa
Want an axe to break the ice
I want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
I want to come down right now

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high

My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said
