We Are The World - U.S.A. For Africa

There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true, we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Well, send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
Oh, there's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true, we'll make a better day
Just you and me

When you're down and out, and there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe, there's no way we can fall
Well, well, well
Let us realize, oh, that a change can only come
When we stand together as one (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true, we'll make a better day
Just you and me

We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
