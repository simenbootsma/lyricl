Brilliant Disguise - Bruce Springsteen

I hold you in my arms
As the band plays
What are those words whispered, baby
Just as you turn away?
I saw you last night
Out on the edge of town
I wanna read your mind to know
Just what I've got in this new thing I've found

So tell me what I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

I heard somebody call your name
From underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame
Underneath your pillow
Well, I've tried so hard, baby
But I just can't see
What a woman like you

So tell me who I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
Oh, when out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I wanna know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

Now you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand
Oh, we stood at the altar
The gypsy swore that our future was right
But come the wee, wee hours

So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
Is that me, baby
Or just a brilliant disguise?

Tonight our bed is cold
I'm lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man
Who doubts what he's sure of
