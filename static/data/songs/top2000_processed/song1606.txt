Bad Liar - Imagine Dragons

Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you’re free to go

Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been askin' for
Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for ( Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin')

So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me

I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

Oh-oh-oh
Please believe me
Please believe me
