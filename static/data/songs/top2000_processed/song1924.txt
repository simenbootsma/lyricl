You Can't Hurry Love - Phil Collins

I need love, love, ooh, to ease my mind
And I need to find time, someone to call mine
My mama said

"You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love (Hoo)
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in the good time
No matter how long it takes"

How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again?
Right now, the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, ooh, it's almost gone
I remember Mama said

"(You can't hurry love)
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take"
How long must I wait? (Hoo)
And how much more must I take
Before loneliness

No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I've grown impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well, these precious words keep me hanging on
I remember Mama said

"(You can't hurry love)
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love (Hoo)
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes"
And now break!

Now love, love, it don't come easy
But I keep on waiting, anticipating
For that soft voice to talk to me at night
For some tender arms, hold me tight
I keep waiting (Hoo)
'Til that day
But it ain't easy, no (Love don't come easy)

"You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love (Hoo)
No, you'll just have to wait"
She said, "Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to waitâ€¦"
