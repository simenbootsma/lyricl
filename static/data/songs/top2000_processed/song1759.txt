Fire - Floor Jansen

Muted are the days, we lost our will
Frozen in a whirlwind that stands still
Time itself is silent, the silence…
Longing for some warmth back on our face
Find a way to get out of this maze
Scream away the silent, the silence

Shadows all around us

Set alight the dark
FIRE
The pounding of our hearts
FIRE
Ignite the fading spark
FIRE
Burn the silence down
Let the fire out

Give this heat a voice and raise it high
No more smoldering ashes of “‘went-bys”

Shadows all around us
Only formed in light, we

Set alight the dark
FIRE
The pounding of our hearts
FIRE
Ignite the fading spark
FIRE
Burn the silence down
Let the fire out

FIRE
FIRE
Ignite the fading spark
FIRE
Burn the silence down
Let the fire out
