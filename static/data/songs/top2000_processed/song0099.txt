Sorry - Kensington

Sorry for the road that I won't take
For the words that I won't say
For the love that I won't give
Sorry for the heart that I won't show
For the lengths that I won't go
For the life that you won't live
Sorry that I opened up my arms
You would never reach in time
Before they closed again

You will forget
And I won't remember it
When all I ever did was race in circles
You will forget
And all there's left will be
A faded memory
A dream you woke up from

Sorry for the oath that I won't take
For the vows that I will break
For the role that I won't play
Sorry that I'm raising up my walls
And whenever you reached over

You will forget
And I won't remember it
When all I ever did was race in circles
You will forget
And all there's left will be
A faded memory
A dream you woke up...

From the colour I would bring
To ending up again
Opening darkness
I wanted to hold you back
From the colour I would bring
To ending up again
Opening darkness
I wanted to hold you back

You will forget
And I won't remember it
When all I ever did was race in circles
You will forget
And all there's left will be
A faded memory
A dream you woke up from
