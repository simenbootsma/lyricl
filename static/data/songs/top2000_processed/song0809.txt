Sovereign Light Cafe - Keane

I'm going back to a time when we owned this town
Down Powder Mill Lane, in the battlegrounds
We were friends and lovers and clueless clowns
I didn't know I was finding out how I'd be torn from you
When we talked about things we were gonna do
We were wide eyed dreamers and wiser too

We'd go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café

I'm begging you for some sign
But you've still got nothing to say
Don't turn your back on me, don't walk away
I'm a better man now than I was that day

Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
And watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear

I wheel my bike off the train
Up the North Trade Road
And look for you in Marley Lane
In every building, every street sign
Oh why did we ever go so far from home?

Well you've got nothing to hide
You can't change who you really are
You can get a big house and a faster car
You can run away boy, but you won't go far

Let's go down to the rides on East Parade
By the lights of the Palace Arcade
Watch night coming down on the Sovereign Light Café
Let's go down to the bandstand on the pier
Watch the drunks and the lovers appear
To take turns, just as the stars of the Sovereign Light Café

Sha-la-la-la-la-la-di-day
Yeah, I'm going where the people know my name
