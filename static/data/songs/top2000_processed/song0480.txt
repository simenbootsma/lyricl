Long Blond Animal - Golden Earring

Get out of my parlour, won't you
Get out of my life
Put on that crazy raincoat
You're gonna need it tonight
Get out of my parlour
'Fore I cut you with a knife
Don't want your disease
Don't need your silly jive

I was an innocent bystander
I was a middle-of-the-road-man for you
Then you took me for a ride, now baby
Showed me all the things you could do
I always listen to the good looking lady
A mistake I won't make no more
'Cause you might be a good looking lady
But you're rotten to the core

I've been under your influence
Under your spell too long
Now people keep me at a distance
Everything I do is wrong
My brain's desintegrating
Devil's singin' my song
This cannot continue

I was an innocent bystander
I was a middle-of-the-road-man for you
Then you took me for a ride, now baby
Showed me all the things you could do
I always listen to the good looking lady
A mistake I won't make no more
'Cause you might be a good looking lady
But you're rotten to the core

I was an innocent bystander
I was a middle-of-the-road-man for you
Then you took me for a ride, now baby
Showed me all the things you could do
I always listen to the good looking lady
A mistake I won't make no more
'Cause you might be a good looking lady
But you're rotten to the core
You're nothing but a long blond animal
