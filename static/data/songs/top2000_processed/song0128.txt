I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For - U2

I have climbed highest mountain
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing fingertips
It burned like fire
This burnin' desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for

I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still runnin'
You broke the bonds and you loosened the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it

But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
