House For Sale - Lucifer

The sun went up one rainy morning
Just a couple hours after dawn
Mrs. Hadley peaked out through her curtains
Wondering what was going on

The neighbors said over coffee cups
That nice young couple is breaking up

And in the living room
The linen and the crystals sit all packed and set to go
I tell myself once more
I won't be here in spring to see my roses grow

And all the things you tried to fix
The roof still leaks, the door still sticks

House for sale
You can read it on the sign
House for sale
It was yours and it was mine
And tomorrow some strangers
Will be climbing up the stairs
To the bedroom filled with memories

I know you always loved that painting
From that funny little shop in Spain
Remember how we found it
When we ducked in from that sudden summer rain

But I think I keep the silver tray
My mother give us on a wedding day

It was yours and it was mine
And tomorrow some strangers
Will be climbing up the stairs
To the bedroom filled with memories
The one we used to share
