Sexual Healing - Marvin Gaye

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Oh baby, now let's get down tonight
Ooh

Baby I'm hot just like an oven (Heal me, my darling)
I need some lovin' (Heal me, my darling)
And baby, I can't hold it much longer (Heal me, my darling)
It's getting stronger and stronger (Heal me, my darling)

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing, baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue teardrops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby, and
Honey, I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing

(Get up, get up, get up, get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
'Cause you do it right

Baby, I got sick this morning (Heal me, my darling)
A sea was storming inside of me (Heal me, my darling)
Baby, I think I'm capsizing (Heal me, my darling)
The waves are rising and rising (Heal me, my darling)

And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

And it's good for me, and it's so good to me
My baby, ohhh
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind, soon we'll be making it, honey
Oh, we're feeling fine
You're my medicine, open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great

(Heal me, my darling)
I can't wait for you to operate

When I get this feeling (Heal me, my darling)
I need sexual healing
Oh, when I get this feeling (Heal me, my darling)
I need sexual healing
I gotta have sexual healing, darling (Heal me, my darling)
'Cause I'm all alone
I need sexual healing, darling (Heal me, my darling)
'Til you come back home
Please don't procrastinate (Heal me, my darling)
It's not good to masturbate
