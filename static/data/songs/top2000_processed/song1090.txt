I Started A Joke - Bee Gees

I started a joke
Which started the whole world crying
But I didn't see
That the joke was on me, oh no

I started to cry
Which started the whole world laughing
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed
Hurting my head from things that I'd said

'Til I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen
That the joke was on me

I looked at the skies
Running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed

'Til I finally died
Which started the whole world living
Oh, if I'd only seen, oh yeah
That the joke was on me

Oh no, that the joke was on me, oh
