Way Down We Go - Kaleo

Oh, Father, tell me, do we get what we deserve?
Oh, we get what we deserve

And way down we go-o-o-o-o
Way down we go-o-o-o-o
Say way down we go
Way down we go

Whoa, you let your feet run wild
Time has come as we all fall, go down
Yeah, but for the fall, my
Do you dare to look 'em right in the eyes? Yeah

Oh, 'cause they will run you down, down 'till the dark
Yes, and they will run you down, down 'till you fall
And they will run you down, down to your core
Yeah, 'till you can't crawl no more

And way down we go-o-o-o-o
Oh, way down we go
Say way down we go
Oh, 'cause they will run you down, down to your core

Ohh
Oh, baby, yeah
Oh, baby, ah-ah
Baby, ooh
Way down we go
Oh, no
Yeah! No, no

Way down we go-o-o-o-o
Oh, way down we go
Say way down we go, ooh
Way down we go
