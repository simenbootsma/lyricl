Suzie Q  - Creedence Clearwater Revival
Parody of "Susie Q (Part 1)" by Creedence Clearwater Revival
Oh, EZ-kiel Oh, EZ-kiel Oh, EZ-kiel, well, he saw a wheel within a wheel
By the riverside, he saw the wheels in flight
Covered with eyes, he saw the wheels in flight, EZ-kiel
It ain't no U.F.O., it ain't no U.F.O., It ain't no U.F.O., the Bible tells you so, EZ-Kiel
It's cherubim divine, it's cherubim divine, it's cherubim divine, baby, prophesy
