You Can Leave Your Hat On - Joe Cocker

Baby, take off your coat
Real slow
Take off your shoes
I'll take off your shoes
Baby, take off your dress
Yes, yes, yes

You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on

Go over there, turn on the lights
All the lights
Come over here, stand on that chair
Yeah, that's right
Raise your arms up in the air
Now shake 'em

You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live

Sweet darling
(You can leave your hat on)
You can leave your hat on
Baby (You can leave your hat on)
You can leave your hat on
(You can leave your hat on)
(You can leave your hat on)

Suspicious minds are talkin'
They're tryin' to tear us apart
They don't believe in this love of mine
They don't know what love is

They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
Well, I know what love is

Oh yeah, no way
(You can leave your hat on)
You can leave your hat on
Baby (You can leave your hat on)
You give me reason to live
You can leave your hat on (You can leave your hat on)
Down in the stones
(You can leave your hat on)
