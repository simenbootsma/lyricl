Killer/Papa Was A Rollin' Stone - George Michael
Killer

So you want to be free?
To live your life the way you want to be
Will you give if we cry?
Will we live or will we die?

Tainted hearts heal with time
Shoot bad love so we can stop the bleeding

Solitary brother
Is there still a part of you that wants to live?
Solitary sister
Is there still a part of you that wants to give?
Solitary brother
Is there still a part of you that wants to live?
Solitary sister
Is there still a part of you that wants to give?

Papa Was A Rollin' Stone

It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
Because that was the day that my daddy died
Never had a chance to see him, no
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth

Papa was a Rollin' Stone
Yeah, wherever he laid his hat was home
And when he died
All he left us was alone
Then my mama she said
(Papa was a Rollin' Stone)
Oh, my mama said
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us, all he left us
Can you believe he left us

All alone, yeah
All alone, yeah
All alone, yeah
Yeah
