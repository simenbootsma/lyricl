Candy - Paolo Nutini

I was perched outside in the pouring rain
Trying to make myself a sail
Then I'll float to you, my darlin'
With the evening on my tail

Although not the most honest means of travel
It gets me there nonetheless
I'm a heartless man at worst, babe
And a helpless one at best

Darling, I'll bathe your skin
I'll even wash your clothes
Just give me some candy before I go
Oh darling, I'll kiss your eyes
And lay you down on your rug
Just give me some candy after my hug

Oh, and I'm often false explaining
But to her it plays out all the same
And although I'm left defeated

I know you got plenty to offer, baby
But I guess I've taken quite enough
Well, I'm some stain there on your bed sheet
You're my diamond in the rough

Darling, I'll bathe your skin
I'll even wash your clothes
Just give me some candy before I go
Oh darling, I'll kiss your eyes
And lay you down on your rug
Just give me some candy after my hug

I know that they're writings on the wall
But darling, I'll bathe your skin
I'll even wash your clothes
Just give me some candy before I go
Oh darling, I'll kiss your eyes and lay you down on your rug
Just give me some candy after my hug

Oh, and I'll be there waiting for you
Oh, I'll be there waiting for you
Oh, I'll be there waiting for you
Oh, I'll be there waiting for you
Oh, I'll be there waiting for you

(Oh, I'll be there waiting for you)
All the cutthroats and their jagged ends
All of them have got me waiting and waiting
(Oh, I'll be there waiting for you)
All the cheap and the sugary philosophies
Have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting
(Oh, I'll be there waiting for you)
All the angels and their halos
All they do is keep me waiting and waiting
(Oh, I'll be there waiting for you)
All the cutthroats and their jagged ends
All of them have got me waiting and waiting
(Oh, I'll be there waiting for you)
All the cheap and the sugary philosophies
Have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting
(Oh, I'll be there waiting for you)
All the angels and their halos
All they do is keep me waiting and waiting
