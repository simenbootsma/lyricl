Fool's Overture - Supertramp

We shall go on till the end...
We shall fight on the seas and oceans...
We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be...
We shall never surrender!

History recalls how great the fall can be
While everybody's sleeping, the boats put out to sea
Born on the wings of time
It seemed the answers were so easy to find
"Too late," the prophets cry
The island's sinking, let's take to the sky

Called the man a fool, stripped him of his pride
Oh, everyone was laughing up until the day he died
Oh, though the wound went deep
Still he's calling us out of our sleep
My friends, we're not alone
He waits in silence to lead us all home

So you tell me that you find it hard to grow
Well I know, I know, I know
And you tell me that you've many seeds to sow
Well I know, I know, I know(distant choir sings 'Jerusalem' almost inaudibly)
And was the Holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen?
And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
Dreamer...

Can you hear what I'm saying
Can you see the parts that I'm playing
"Holy man, rocker man, come on, Queenie
Joker Man, Spider Man, blue-eyed Meanie"
So you found your solution
What will be your last contribution?
"Live it up, rip it up, why so lazy?
Give it out, dish it out, let's go crazy
Yeah!"
