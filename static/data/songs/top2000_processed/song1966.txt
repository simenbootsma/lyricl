Live And Let Die - Paul McCartney & Wings

When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say, "Live and let live
"
(You know you did
You know you did
You know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we're livin'
Makes you give in and cry

Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)


What does it matter to ya?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You gotta give the other fella hell!

You used to say live and let live
(You know you did
You know you did
You know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we're livin'

Say live and let die
(Live and let die)
Live and let die
(Live and let die)
