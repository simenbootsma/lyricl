Nickel For Goodbye - Racoon

I almost went to your house
Heard something about
A way to forget about things
But the newspaper said
There's bad weather ahead
So I kept on staying in bed
And it broke the day
Yeah, it sure broke the day

And the neon commercials
They were screaming insane
"You should get up 'cause you got shit to do"
Meanwhile people all dress up and do what they do
It doesn't mean that I have to

Just give me a nickel for "I'm sorry"
And a nickel for my pride
Give me a nickel for the things I've done wrong in my life
Give me a nickel for friendship
And a nickel for the fights
Give me a nickel for "hello"

Some fools remember all that they say
And forget about all that they hear
Well, I don't wanna be that fool that goes blind through the day
I wanna hear what I need to hear
Just don't break my heart
Just don't break my heart

And good friends remember good times that they got
And buried the bad ones for later
A few words of wisdom I gladly forgot
'Cause mistakes I've been making for ages

But they don't give a nickel for "I'm sorry"
And no nickel for who's right
No nickel for the things I've done wrong in my life
No nickel for friendship
And two shits about a fight
No nickel for "hello"
Only a nickel for "goodbye"
Just a nickel for "goodbye"

And the drink, it was fading, it felt so frustrating
So I went to your house
Though they warned me, they said there was trouble ahead

Just to get a nickel for "I'm sorry"
And a nickel for my pride
A nickel for the things I've done wrong in my life
To get a nickel for friendship
And a nickel for the fights
To get a nickel for "hello"
Maybe a nickel for "goodbye"
Give me a nickel for "goodbye"
Good, goodbye
