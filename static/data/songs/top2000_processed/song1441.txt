Memories - Earth & Fire

If you have been away and left this world behind
So far away, no problems on your mind

Alone again, feeling very sad
Left with your memories

If you have been away and made a lot of fun
No place to stay, always on the run

Alone again, feeling very sad
Left with your memories

Is it really worthwhile?
Is it really worthwhile?

Now if you've been away and wandered on the shores
Games to play, so what you've been looking for?

Alone again, feeling very sad
Left with your memories
Left with your memories

If you have been away and left this world behind
So far away, no problems on your mind

Alone again, feeling very sad
Left with your memories

If you have been away and made a lot of fun
No place to stay, always on the run

Alone again, feeling very sad
Left with your memories

Is it really worthwhile?
Is it really worthwhile?

Now if you've been away and wandered on the shores
Games to play, so what you've been looking for?

Alone again, feeling very sad
Left with your memories
Left with your memories
