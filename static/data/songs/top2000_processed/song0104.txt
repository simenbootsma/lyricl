Phantom Of The Opera - Floor Jansen & Henk Poort
Floor Jansen, Henk Poort, Together
In sleep, he sang to me, in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again? For now, I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear...
Your/My spirit and my/your voice
In one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my/your mindIn all your fantasies, you always knew
That man and mystery
Were both in you
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my/your mind...
Sing, my Angel of Music!
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel of Music!
Sing for me!
Sing for me!
