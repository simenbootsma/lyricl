Proud Mary - Ike & Tina Turner


Y'know, every now and then
I think you might like to hear something from us
Nice and easy
Left a good job down in the city
But there's just one thing
You see, we never, ever do nothing
Working for the man every night and day
Nice and easy
Well, I never lost one minute of sleeping
We always do it nice and rough
Worrying 'bout the way that things might've been
So we're going to take the beginning of this song
And do it easy
Big wheel, keep on turning
But then we're going to do the finish rough
Proud Mary, keep on burning
This is the way we do "Proud Mary"
And we're rolling, ooh
Rolling, ooh
Rolling on the river
Listen to the story

Left a good job down in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping

You know that big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary, keep on burning
And we're rolling (rolling)
Rolling, yeah (rolling)
Rolling on the river (rolling on the river)

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
You know I
pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

You know the big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary, keep on burning
And we're rolling (rolling)
Rolling, yeah (rolling)
Rolling on the river (rolling on the river)
Said we're rolling (rolling)
Rolling, yeah (rolling)
Rolling on the river (rolling on the river)

Oh, I left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleeping

Big wheel, keep on turning (turning)
Proud Mary, keep on burning (burning)
Rolling
Rolling
Rolling on the river
Say we're rolling
We're rolling
Rolling on the river

River, do do do do do do do do do do
Alright!

I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

Big wheel, keep on turning (turning)
Proud Mary, keep on burning (burning)
And we're rolling
Said we're rolling
We're rolling on the river
I tell you, we're rolling
Rolling

River, do do do do do do do do do do
Alright!
Yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh

If you come down to the river
I bet you gonna find some people who live
And you don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel, keep on turning (turning)
Proud Mary, keep on burning (burning)
And we're rolling
Said we're rolling
Yeah, we're rolling on the river
Tell me one more time
(Rolling) Yeah
(Rolling) Alright
(Rolling on the river) Whoo, yeah

River, do do do do do do do do do do
Yeah
Alright
Uh-huh
Wooo
Ohh

Rolling, rolling, yeah
Rolling on the river
We're rolling, yeah, rolling
We're rolling on the river
Said we're rolling, rolling, yeah
Rolling on the river
I tell you, we're rolling, we're rolling
We're rolling on the river
Yeah
Alright
Huh
