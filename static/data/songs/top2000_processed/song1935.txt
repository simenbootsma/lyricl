Liberian Girl - Michael Jackson

Nakupenda pia
Nakutaka pia
Mpenzi we'

Liberian girl, you came and you changed my world
A love so brand new
Liberian girl, you came and you changed me, girl
A feeling so true

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says, "Do you love me?"
And he says, "So endlessly
I love you, Liberian girl"

Nakupenda pia
Nakutaka pia (Ooh-ooh, baby)
Mpenzi we'
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

Liberian girl, more precious than any pearl
Your love's so complete
Liberian girl, you kiss me, then, ooh, the world
You do this to me

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says, "Do you love me?"
And he says, "So endlessly
I love you, Liberian girl"

Nakupenda pia
Nakutaka pia (Ooh-ooh, baby)
Mpenzi we'
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
I wait for the day
When you have to say, "I do"
And I'll smile and say it too

I love you, Liberian girl all the time
I love you, Liberian girl all the time
I love you, Liberian girl all the time
I love you, Liberian girl all the time

I love you (Girl)
I love you, baby
I want you
I love you, baby, ooh (Girl)
I love you, baby
I want you, baby, ooh (Girl)
