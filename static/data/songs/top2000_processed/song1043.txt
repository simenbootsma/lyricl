Go Like Elijah - Chi Coltrane
Someday my time to die will come
When that will be I don't know
I only know that when I have to go
Oh yeah
'Cause when I go (When I go), I wanna go (I wanna go)
Just let me go (Just let me go), oooh, yeah, when I go (Yeah, when I go)
I wanna go (I wanna go), Lord, let me go
Just let me go like Elijah when I go
I wanna rise right up into the sky
And ride white horses with fiery eyes
Lord, for my sins I apologize
Just let me go (Just let me go), Lord, when I go (Lord, when I go)
When my time comes for me to go
I wanna go like Elijah when I go
I don't want no tombstone above my head
And I don't want no pinebox for my bed, oh no
And I don't want anyone to say I'm dead, oh no
'Cause when I go (Yeah, when I go), I wanna go (I wanna go)
Just let me go (Just let me go), oooh, yeah, when I go (Yeah, when I go)
I wanna go (I wanna go), Lord, let me go
Just let me go like Elijah when I goI wanna rise right up into the sky
And ride white roses with fiery eyes
Lord, for my sins I apologize
Just let me go (Just let me go), I wanna go go (I wanna go)
When my time comes for me to go
Just let me go like Elijah when I go
Ooohooohooo, yeaheah
I don't want know one cryin' or feelin' sad
Or standin' in the rain without their hat, oh no
I wanna go happy, imagine that
'Cause when I go (Yeah, when I go), just let me go (I wanna go)
I wanna go (Just let me go), oooh, yeah, when I go (Yeah, when I go)
Just let me go (I wanna go), Lord, when I go
I wanna go like Elijah when I go
I wanna rise right up into the sky
And ride white roses with fiery eyes
Lord, for my sins I apologize
Just let me go (Just let me go), I wanna go (Lord, when I go)
When my time comes for me to go
Just let me go like Elijah when I go (When I go, when I go)I wanna go like Elijah when I go (When I go, when I go)
Just let me go like Elijah when I go
