Like The Way I Do - Melissa Etheridge

Is it so hard to satisfy your senses?
You found out to love me you have to climb some fences
Scratching and crawling along the floor to touch you
And just when it feels right
You say you found someone to hold you
Does she like I do?

Baby, tell me, does she love you like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?
Tell me, does she miss you, existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do?
Tell me, does she want you, infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you, electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you
Like the way I do?
Like the way I do?

Can I survive all the implications?
Even if I tried, could you be less than an addiction?
Don't you think I know there's so many others
Who would beg, steal and lie
And fight, kill and die
Just to hold you

Baby, tell me, does she love you like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?
Tell me, does she miss you, existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do?
Tell me, does she want you, infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you, electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you
Like the way I do?

Oh, nobody loves you like the way I do
Nobody wants you like the way I do
Nobody needs you like the way I do
Nobody aches
Nobody aches just to hold you
Like the way I do
No, no, no

Tell me, does she love you like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?
Baby, baby, tell me, does she miss you, existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do?
No, tell me, does she want you, infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you, electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you, seduce you and affect you, baby
Like the way I do?
No, like the way I do?
Oh yeah
