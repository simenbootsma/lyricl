Addicted To You - Avicii

I don't know just how it happened
I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again
But I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it comin' (Ah)
Caught me by surprise (Ah)
Wasn't lookin' where I was goin'
I fell into your eyes

You came into my crazy world
Like a cool and cleansing rain
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby
You were flowin' through my veins

I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drownin' in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you

Midnight blows in through the window (Ah)
Dances 'round the room (Ah)
Got me hypnotised

I couldn't live without you now
Oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain

I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drownin' in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'mï»¿ addicted to you
