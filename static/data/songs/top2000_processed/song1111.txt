Hard To Say Goodbye - Rondé

Here we are, six years later
I don't know what we’re trying to find, to find (To find)
We've been dancing with strangers
Could it be we've been wasting our time, our time? (Our time)

Every night, I lay in bed
Wish I was with you instead
I can hear you in my sleep
If only we had one more day
Wake up and we’d be okay
I still see you in my dreams

It's hard to say goodbye
Oh, I tried couple million times
Missed a million signs, oh, yeah, yeah
Something about you made me try
And I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why, oh, yeah, yeah
It's hard to say goodbye
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Whеn we talk, days are fading
I don't know what you're saying
My lovе, my love
Yeah, I know times are changing
When I leave, I’m still staying
Two hearts, so lost

Every night, I lay in bed
Wish I was with you instead
I can hear you in my sleep

It’s hard to say goodbye
Oh, I tried couple million times
Missed a million signs, oh, yeah, yeah
Something about you made me try
And I don't know why
Oh, I don’t know why, oh, yeah, yeah
It's hard to say goodbye
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
It's hard to say goodbye

And I don’t know why
