Lost - Anouk

If roses are meant to be red
And violets to be blue
Why isn't my heart meant for you?
My hands longing to touch you
But I can barely breathe
Starry eyes that make me melt
Right in front of me

Lost in this world
I even get lost in this song
And when the lights go down
That is where I'll be found

This music's irresistible
Your voice makes my skin crawl
Innocent and pure
I guess you heard it all before
Mister Inaccessible
Will this ever change?
One thing that remains the same
You're still a picture in a frame

Lost in this world
I even get lost in this song
And when the lights go down
That is where I'll be found
I get lost in this world
I get lost in your eyes
And when the lights go down


Lost in this world
I get lost in your eyes
So when the lights go down
Why am I the only one?
