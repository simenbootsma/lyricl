War - Kensington

So, cut my hands and pull my arms in
All unforeseen but no surprise
For all the men in all your armies
Throw only bait that no one bites

Up and away we all go, into the way we run
There you will find our stronghold, though you won't find our guns
Up and away we all go, into the way we run
There you will find our stronghold

We won't go to war
(Hey!) No, we won't go to war
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Hey!) No, we won't go to war
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Say, all your time is almost done here
Waste all your light on other ones

Up and away we all go, into the way we run

We won't go to war
(Hey!) No, we won't go to war
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Hey!) No, we won't go to war
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Hey!) No, we won't go to war
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Hey!) No, we won't go to war
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

We're getting away
We're getting away
We're getting away
We're getting away
We're getting away (Oh-oh)
We're getting away (Oh-oh)
We're getting away (Oh-oh)
We're getting away (Oh-oh)

(Hey!) No, we won't go to war
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Hey!) No, we won't go to war
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(To deny it, to deny it
Is to go when you know that you're in it)
(Hey!) No, we won't go to war
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Hey!) No, we won't go to war
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
