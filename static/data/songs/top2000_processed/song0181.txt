Three Little Birds - Bob Marley & The Wailers

Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright"

Rise up this morning, smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds pitch by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Saying, "This is my message to you-ou-ou"

Singing, "Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright"
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing" (Don't worry)
"'Cause every little thing gonna be alright"

Rise up this morning, smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds pitch by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Saying, "This is my message to you-ou-ou"

Singing, "Don't worry about a thing" (Worry 'bout a thing, oh)
"Every little thing gonna be alright" (Don't worry)
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing" (I won't worry)
"'Cause every little thing gonna be alright"
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright" (I won't worry)
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright"
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing" (Don't worry 'bout a thing)
"'Cause every little thing gonna be alright"
