Little Green Bag - George Baker Selection

Yeah

Lookin' back on the track for a little greenback
Got to find just the kind or losin' my mind
Out of sight in the night, out of sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track, gonna do it my way
Out of sight in the night, out of sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track, gonna do it my way
Lookin' back

Lookin' for some happiness
But there is only loneliness to find
Jump to the left, turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs, lookin' behind
Lookin' for some happiness
But there is only loneliness to find
Jump to the left, turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs, lookin' behind

Lookin' back on the track for a little greenback
Got to find just the kind or losin' my mind
Out of sight in the night, out of sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track, gonna do it my way
Lookin' back on the track for a little, little greenback

Lookin' for some happiness
But there is only loneliness to find
Jump to the left, turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs, lookin' behind
Lookin' for some happiness
But there is only loneliness to find
Turn to the left, turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs, lookin' behind
