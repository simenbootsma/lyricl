I Still Cry - Ilse DeLange

I'm making flowers out of paper
While darkness takes the afternoon
I know that they won't last forever
But real ones fade away too soon

I still cry sometimes when I remember you
I still cry sometimes when I hear your name
I said goodbye and I know you're alright now
But when the leaves start falling down I still cry

It's just that I recall September
It's just that I still hear your song
It's just I can't seem to remember
Forever more those days are gone

I still cry sometimes when I remember you
I still cry sometimes when I hear your name
I said goodbye and I know you're alright now
But when the leaves start falling down I still cry

I still cry sometimes when I remember you
I still cry sometimes when I hear your name
I said goodbye and I know you're alright now
But when the leaves start falling down I still cry
But when the leaves start falling down I still cry
