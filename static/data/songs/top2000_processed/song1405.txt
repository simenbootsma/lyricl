Riddles - Kensington

Get it now, tell me how to get it now
To hold it in or let it out
Tell me to go or stay
Headed now, show me where we're headed now
If only I'd have read the signs
I wouldn't be here goin' to waste
I really don't know

Oh, lost it a little
Don't go, must be a riddle
Don't you know
Oh, lost in your riddles, lost in your riddles

Where we will go, we'll be lost in the middle
Where we will go, I'll be lost in your riddle

Better now, tell me, is it better now?
Keep you right here by my side
Oh, heavy like smoke to fell
Settle down, if only I could settle down
I know that I'd have read the lines
I wouldn't be here goin' to waste

Oh, lost it a little
Don't go, must be a riddle
Don't you know
Oh, I'm lost in your riddles, lost in your riddles
But I really wanna know
Oh, lost it a little
Don't go, must be a riddle
Don't you know
Oh, I'm lost in your riddles, lost in your riddles

Where we will go, we'll be lost in the middle
Where we will go, I'll be lost in your riddle
Where we will go, we'll be lost in the middle
Where we will go, I'll be lost in your riddle


Where we will go, we'll be lost in the middle
Where we will go, I'll be lost in your riddle
Where we will go, we'll be lost in the middle
Where we will go, I'll be lost in your riddle
