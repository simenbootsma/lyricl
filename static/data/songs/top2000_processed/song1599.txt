Hold On To Let Go - Danny Vera

See no walls, so I'm free
There's no place I'd rather be
On this misty morning in this old town
With only hope and a message for the lonely

Got my head high
Got my soul shining
Got my tears flowing
Got the wheels turning
Got the sunshine
Got ideas lighting
Got the whole world beside me
Got to hold on to let go
Got to hold on to let go

I sit here on my porch
Feel the wind, I'm free I'm sure
I'll leave the outside world for what it's worth
Oh, my only hope is to ignore feeling lonely

Got my head high
Got my soul shining
Got my tears flowing
Got the wheels turning
Got the sunshine
Got ideas lighting
Got the whole world beside me
Got to hold on to let go


Got my head high
Got my soul shining
Got my tears flowing
Got the wheels turning
Got the sunshine
Got ideas lighting
Got the whole world beside me
Got to hold on to let go
Got to hold on to let go
