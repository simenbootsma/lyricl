No Mercy - Racoon

She walks in and says, "Come on, let's have it"
She brings out the worst you can be
That's a good day for a bad habit
Don't you dare to disagree
(She likes to surf alone)
Cheap bastard thinks he's something groovy
Straight down from church, you wanna bet
She'll play him like some kinda movie
Then smokes the last of his cigarettes

She's got no mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
And no mercy for no king
No mercy for no king

She picks his heart like it's a pocket
She wears her hair like it's a crown
She sees straight through all his cool poses

She's got no mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the king

Oh, there won't be any mercy
Not unless you got a diamond ring
Oh, no, there won't be no "excuse me"
No mercy for the king of everything

No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the king
No mercy for no soldiers
No mercy for no king
No mercy, oh, no mercy
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for the soldiers
No mercy for no king
No mercy for no king
