Rooster - Alice In Chains

Ooh-ooh-ooh-hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stingin' sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere
, mm-mm
Wife and kids, household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere, mm-mm

Here they come to snuff the Rooster, aw, yeah
Yeah, here come the Rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die


Here they come to snuff the Rooster, aw, yeah
Yeah, here come the Rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die

Walkin' tall, machine-gun man
They spit on me in my homeland
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy, mm-mm
Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathin' his dyin' breath
Oh, God, please, won't you help me make it through? Mm-mm

Here they come to snuff the Rooster, aw yeah
Yeah, here come the Rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, you know he ain't gonna die

Ooh-ooh-ooh-hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-hoo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
