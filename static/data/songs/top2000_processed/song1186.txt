Mr. Bojangles - Robbie Williams
I knew a man Bojangles
And he'll dance for you
In worn out shoes
With silver hair and ragged shirt, baggy pants
He would do the old soft shoe
He would jump so high
Jump so high
Then he'd lightly touch down
Told me of the time
He worked with, with minstrel shows
Traveling throughout the south
Spoke with tears for fifteen years
How his, how his dog and he
They would travel about
But his dog up and died
Got up and died
After twenty years he still grieves
He said 'I dance now
At every chance in honky-tonks
For my drinks and tips
But most the time I, I spend behind these country bars
You see son I drinks a bit'
Then he shook his head
Oh Lord, when he shook his head
I can swear I heard somebody saying please, pleaseThat's Mister Bojangles
Calling Mister Bojangles
Mister Bojangles, come back and dance and dance
And dance, please, dance
Mister Bojangles
Mister Bojangles
Mister Bojangles, come back and dance and dance
And dance, please, dance
Come back and dance again, Mister Bojangles
