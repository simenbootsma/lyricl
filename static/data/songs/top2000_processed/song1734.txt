Weekend - Earth & Fire

Sunday and it's so hard to say goodbye
I don't know what to do
Passin' the days without you
Friday night when I see you again
You'll make a fool out of me
I don't wanna be your lover for the weekend

Sometimes when I'm looking at your face
There's something in your eyes
That makes me realize
We've got no chance if we're going on this way
You mean such a lot to me
I don't wanna be your lover for the weekend

Love (Love) in a woman's heart
I wanna have it whole and not apart
It's strange that this feeling grows more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before
