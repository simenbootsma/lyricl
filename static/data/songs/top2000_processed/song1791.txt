Shoes Of Lightning - Racoon

How I wish for a flame that never dies
Like a candle and it’s flame bring back the light
You put on your shoes of lightning
You put on your shoes and run
You’ll be the lightning bolt
So put them on
Put on your shoes of fire
You put on your shoes that burn
If you get burned, my love
Well that’s exactly how you learn

Bring on the day to come
And you wear it like a brand new one
You put on your shoes of lightning
Let them run
You let them run

There’s always an ugly duckling
There’s always an ugly one
Give her a chance to grow
Into a pretty, pretty one
There’s always a mean machine
There’s always a beauty queen
Always so many fools

Bring on the day to come
And you wear it like a brand new one
Put on the shoes of lightning
Let them run
You let them run
Bring on the day to come
And wear it like a brand new one
Put on your shoes of lightning
Put them on
Let them run

Zap away on your tv
Things that you don’t wanna see
Get your head out of your ass
Ignorance is such bliss
Don’t you stand there like the rest
Without a heart you’ll finish last
Without a heart you’ll finish last

Bring on the day to come
And wear it like a brand new one
You put on the shoes of lightning
Put them on
You put them on
Bring on the day to come
And you wear it like a brand new one
Put on the shoes of lightning
Let them run
You let them run
Bring on the day to come
And wear it like it’s a brand new one
Put on your shoes of lightning

I wish for a flame that never dies
Like a candle and it’s flame bring back the light
