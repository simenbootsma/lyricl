Skyfall - Adele

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together at Skyfall
At Skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together at Skyfall

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me without the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand

Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)

Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At Skyfall
Ooh
