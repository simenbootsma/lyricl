This World Is Our Home - Douwe Bob

All right

Boots on the ground, heart in the sky
I'm living life not asking why
Wasn't raised on open fields
Or underneath the big blue skies
Haven't seen the world from every side
But I've felt the rain, I've felt the tide
Don't feel the urge to break away
From what I know and who I've got
Some people spend their lifetime
Waiting from a sign from up above
And I found my purpose being with the people
The people that I love

Staring at the stars in the sky tonight
I'm at a place where I belong
Never felt so much alive
And we shout out, "This world's our home"
I can feel it in the air tonight
I'm at a place where I belong
My heart is open wide
And we shout out, "This world's our home"
This world's our home

We all try our best to tell a story people wanna hear
Then you realize that silence is a sound you truly fear
And every scar that has been made
Won't fade in poetry and beer

Staring at the stars in the sky tonight
I'm at a place where I belong
Never felt so much alive
And we shout out, "This world's our home"
I can feel it in the air tonight
I'm at a place where I belong
My heart is open wide
And we shout out, "This world's our home"
Oh, this world's our home
Yeah, this world's our home

Feel the sun, feel the rain, touch the grass
Woah, this world's our home
See the stars, see the moon, kiss the sky

Staring at the stars in the sky tonight
I'm at a place where I belong
Never felt so much alive
And we shout out, "This world's our home"
I can feel it in the air tonight
I'm at a place where I belong
My heart is open wide
And we shout out, "This world's our home"
Oh, this world's our home

Feel the sun, feel the rain, touch the grass
Woah, woah, this world's our home
See the stars, see the moon, kiss the sky
Yeah, this world's our home
