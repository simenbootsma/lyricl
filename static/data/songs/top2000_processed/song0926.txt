Goodbye Stranger  - Supertramp


Was an early morning yesterday
I was up before the dawn
And I really have enjoyed my stay
But I must be moving on

Like a king without a castle
Like a queen without a throne
I'm an early morning lover
And I must be moving on, yeah, yeah

Now, I believe in what you say
Is the undisputed truth
But I have to have things my own way
To keep me in my youth

Like a ship without an anchor
Like a slave without a chain
Just the thought of those sweet ladies
Sends a shiver through my veins
And I will go on shining
Shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me

Goodbye stranger, it's been nice
Hope you'll find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true
Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane
Will we ever meet again?
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain
Sweet devotion, it's not for me
(Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane)
Just give me motion and set me free
(Will we ever meet again?)
In the land and the ocean, far away
(Feel no sorrow, feel no shame)
It's the life I've chosen, every day
(Come tomorrow, feel no pain)
So goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane
(Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane)
Will we ever meet again?
(Will we ever meet again?)

Now, some they do and some they don't
And some you just can't tell
And some they will and some they won't

You can laugh at my behavior
That'll never bother me
Say the devil is my savior
But I don't pay no heed
And I will go on shining
Shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me
My troubles will be few

Goodbye stranger, it's been nice
Hope you'll find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true
Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane
Will we ever meet again?
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain
Sweet devotion, it's not for me
(Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane)
Just give me motion and set me free
(Will we ever meet again?)
In the land and the ocean, far away
(Feel no sorrow, feel no shame)
It's the life I've chosen, every day
(Come tomorrow, feel no pain)
And now I'm leaving, got to go
(Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane)
Hit the road, I'll say it once again
(Will we ever meet again?)
Oh yes, I'm leaving, got to go
(Feel no sorrow, feel no shame)
Got to go, I'm sorry, I must tell you
(Come tomorrow, feel no pain)
Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane
(Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane)
Will we ever meet again?

Go and believe it
I've got to go
