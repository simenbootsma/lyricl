So Incredible - Ilse DeLange

In the middle of the day, when the sun is aching
And I try to make my way, but the sidewalk's breaking
Watch me slip between the cracks, as I fall and fall and fall
And I wonder where I land, if I ever land at all
Oh, there's your hand

So incredible, the love we have
The things we hold, let's make them last
You pull me through
When I get stuck in other little distractions
So incredible
So incredible

In the middle of the night, when the stars all gather
They conspire with the sky, I'm sure it's me they're after
Try to steal away my dreams, keep them for themselves
As I'm stirring in my sleep, please just help me wake up
Oh, there's your hand

So incredible, the love we have
The things we hold, let's make them last
You pull me through
When I get stuck in other little distractions
Everything happens

Everything that we know
Is spinning out of control
You never let me go, woah

So incredible, the love we have
The things we hold, let's make them last
You pull me through
When I get stuck in other little distractions
Everything happens
I still know, so incredible
So incredible
So incredible
