Year Of Summer - Wildstylez ft. Niels Geusebroek

The clouds have gone away
To start a brighter day
We have waited for too long
It's time to let it out
You know what it's about
I've waited all to feel the sun

The harder it gets, the faster we seem to fall in love
The deeper we fall, the more we lose control

Set your mind free, it's the year of summer
Keep your heart strong cause it's all that's here
Set your mind free, it's the year of summer
Can you hear the summer's here?

Oh, oh-o-o-o-oh, oo-oh

The harder it gets, the faster we seem to fall in love
The deeper we fall, the more we lose control

Set your mind free, it's the year of summer
Keep your heart strong cause it's all that's here
Set your mind free, it's the year of summer
Can you hear the summer's here?

The clouds have gone away
To start a brighter day
We have waited for too long
