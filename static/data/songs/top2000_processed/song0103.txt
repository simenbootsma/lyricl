When The Lady Smiles  - Golden Earring

When the lady smiles
You know it drives me wild
Her lips are warm and resourceful
When her fingertips go drawing
Circles in the night
Then the mood is soft and sensual
And I love it, yeah I love it
It's the answer to all my dreams

Every time it feels like the earth is shaking
It doesn't matter
A glass is falling
I hear it shatter
Maybe it's raining
Faster and faster
Shadow dancing

Together oh I
I'm a-betting on the game of love
Oh oh oh I
I'm betting that love is gonna come out
When the walls no longer shout

When the lady smiles
She holds me in her hand
As a matter of fact
She could always let me down
But when the lady smiles
I can't resist her call
As a matter of fact
I don't resist at all
'Cause I'm walking on clouds
And she is leading the way

My friends tell me
She is the beast inside your paradise
I guess you've heard it all before
A fallen angel
That has got you hypnotized
And that always needs some more
And I love it, yeah I love it
She's done nothing to mislead me

'Cause every time we meet
The earth is shaking
It doesn't matter
A glass is falling
I hear it shatter
Maybe it's raining
Faster and faster

Together oh I
I'm betting on the game of love
Oh oh oh I
I'm betting that love is gonna come out
When the walls no longer shout
Back at me, and I'm feeling proud

When the lady smiles
She holds me in her hand
As a matter of fact
She could always let me down
But when the lady smiles
I can't resist her call
As a matter of fact
I don't resist at all
'Cause we're walking on clouds
And she is leading

Oh no, oh no, oh nooooo......
