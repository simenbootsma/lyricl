Birds - Anouk
Isolated from the outside
Clouds have taken all the light
I have no control
It seems my thoughts wonder all of the time
When I try to live life without you
Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
If being myself is what I do wrong
Then I would rather not be right
Hopes turned into fear
And with my one wing I can't fly with sunrise
Embrace my dreams tight
And that's why
Birds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
Birds
To a place without fear with no moonlight
All I need are trees and flowers and some sunlight
Where memories are being made
And where the old one dies
Where love ain't lostBirds falling down the rooftops
Out of the sky like raindrops
No air, no pride
That's why birds don't fly
