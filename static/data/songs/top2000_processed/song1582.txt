Make Me Smile  - Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel
You've done it all, you've broken every code
And pulled the rebel to the floor
You spoilt the game, no matter what you say
For only metal, what a bore
Blue eyes, blue eyes, how come you tell so many lies?
Come up and see me, make me smile
Or do what you want, runnin' wild
There's nothing left, all gone and run away
Maybe you'll tarry for a while
It's just a test, a game for us to play
Win or lose, it's hard to smile
Resist, resist, it's from yourself you have to hide
Oh, come up and see me, to make me smile
Oh, or do what you want, runnin' wild
There ain't no more, you've taken everything
From my belief in Mother Earth
Can you ignore my faith in everything?
'Cause I know what faith is and what it's worth
Away, away, and don't say maybe you'll tryOh, come up and see me to make me smile
Or do what you want just runnin' wild
(Come up and see me, make me smile)
(Or do what you want, runnin' wild)
