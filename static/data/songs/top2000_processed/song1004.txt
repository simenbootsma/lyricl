Heaven - Niall Horan

Strange light revolves around you
You float across the room
Your touch is made of something
Heaven can't hold a candle to
You're made of something new
Let's not get complicated
Let's just enjoy the view
It's hard to be a human
So much to put an answer to
But that's just what we do

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

I'm having revelations
You dance across the floor
Beyond infatuation
How I obsessively adore you
That's what I do

I believe, I believe
I could die in your kiss
No, it doesn't get, doesn't get

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same
God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

(Heaven won't be the same)

I believe, I believe
I could die in your kiss
No, it doesn't get, doesn't get
Better than, better than this

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control (Even if our love)
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same
God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow out of control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same
