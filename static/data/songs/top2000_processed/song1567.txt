Appleknockers Flophouse - Cuby & the Blizzards
Appleknockers flophouse that's were we live in
Such a good place for you and for me
If you come to our Appleknockers flophouse
You don't know what you're bound to see
Come, baby, give me your hand
Come with me now, try to reach the end
If you don't believe what I'm going to say
Go ahead girl and find your own way
Appleknockers flophouse it's a place in the sun
The only thing you can do is come and have some fun
So if you come to our Appleknockers place
Be kind to us honey, wear a smile on your face

Such a good place for you and me
If you come to our Appleknockers flophouse
You don't know what you're bound to see
