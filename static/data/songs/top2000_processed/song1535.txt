The Way It Is - Bruce Hornsby & The Range


Standing in line, marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old ladies' eyes
Just for fun, he says, "Get a job"

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
Ha, but don't you believe them

They say, "Hey, little boy, you can't go where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do"
Said, "Hey, old man, how can you stand to think that way?
Did you really think about it before you made the rules?"
He said, "Son

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is"
Ha, but don't you believe them


That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is

Well, they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got a little more
But it only goes so far
'Cause the law don't change another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar, ooh, no

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is, it is, it is, it is
