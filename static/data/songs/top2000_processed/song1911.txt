Feeling Good - Muse

Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Reeds drifting on by, you know how I feel

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom in the trees, you know how I feel

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know?
Butterflies are all having fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when the day is done
And this old world is a new world

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Yeah, freedom is mine and you know how I feel

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me

Butterfly, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Freer than you
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Feeling good
