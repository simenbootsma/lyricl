My Way - Herman Brood
And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friends I say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've loved a life that's full
I've travelled each and every highway
And more much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets I had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without excemption
I planned each chattered course
Each careful stap along the highway
And more much more than that
I did it my way
Yes there were times
I'm sure you knew
When I bit more off then I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spitt it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my wayI've loved I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way
For what is a man
What has he got
If not himelf than he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
