San Quentin  - Johnny Cash
I was thinking about you guy yesterday
I've been here three times before, and
I think I understand a little bit how you feel about some things
It's none of my business how you feel about some other things
And I don't give a damn about how you feel about some of the things
But anyways
I try to put myself in your place
And I believe this is the way that I would feel about San Quentin
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen 'em die
And long ago I stopped askin' why
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me through and thru
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man;
Mister Congressman, you can't understand
(San Quentin)
San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul;
And you stone walls turn my blood a little cold
San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall down and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
Thank you very much
(One more time) One more time?
Hey, before we do it, if uh
Any of the guards are still speaking to me, could I have a glass of water?
