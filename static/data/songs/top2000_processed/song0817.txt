Where Is My Mind - Pixies

Ooh—stop

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, (Yeah) yeah
Your head will collapse, if there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Where is my mind? Where is my mind?)
(Where is my mind?)
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hidin' behind the rock
Except the little fish
Bump into me, swear he's tryin' a talk to me, say wait, wait

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Where is my mind? Where is…)


With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah (Brr)
Your head will collapse, if there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
(Where is my mind? Where is…)
(Where is my mind?)
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
