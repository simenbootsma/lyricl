Good Vibrations - The Beach Boys

I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom-bop-bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop-bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop-bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop-bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop-bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop-bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom-bop-bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop-bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop-bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop-bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop-bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop-bop)

(Ahh)
(Ah, my-my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my-my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my-my, what elation)
(Oh, my-my, what)
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'
(Ah)

Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom-bop-bop)
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations, good vibrations bop-bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop-bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
