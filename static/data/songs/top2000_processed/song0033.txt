Master Of Puppets - Metallica


End of passion play, crumbling away
, I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear, leading on your death's construction
Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killing you

Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your
master, master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

Needlework the way, never you betray
, life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
, chop your breakfast on a mirror
Taste me, you will see, more is all you need

Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your
master, master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

(Master, master, master, master)


Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries


Hell is worth all that, natural habitat, just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days, now your life is out of season
I will occupy
, I will help you die
I will run through you, now I rule you too

Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your
master, master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
