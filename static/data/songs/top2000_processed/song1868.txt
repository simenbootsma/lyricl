Rivers Of Babylon - Boney M.

By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion
By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion

When the wicked
Carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
Now how shall we sing the Lord's song
In a strange land?
When the wicked
Carried us away in captivity
Requiring of us a song
Now how shall we sing the Lord's song
In a strange land?

Let the words of our mouth and the meditations of our heart
Be acceptable in thy sight here tonight
Let the words of our mouth and the meditation of our hearts

By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion
By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion


By the rivers of Babylon
(Dark tears of Babylon)
There we sat down
(You got to sing a song)
Yeah we wept
(Sing a song of love)
When we remembered Zion
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
By the rivers of Babylon
(Rough bits of Babylon)
There we sat down
(You hear the people cry)
Yeah we wept
(They need their god)
When we remembered Zion
(Ooh, have the power)
