The Weight - The Band

I pulled in to Nazareth
Was feeling 'bout half past dead
I just need someplace
Where I can lay my head
"Hey, mister, can you tell me
Where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand
"No" was all he said

Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
And (And, and)
You put the load right on me (You put the load right on me)

I picked up my bag
I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil
Walking side-by-side
I said, "Hey Carmen
Come on, let's go downtown"
She said, "I gotta go

Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
And (And, and)
You put the load right on me (You put the load right on me)

Go down, Miss Moses
There's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and
Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day
"Well, Luke, my friend
What about young Anna Lee?"
He said, "Do me a favor, son
Won't ya stay and keep Anna Lee company?"

And take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
And (And, and)
You put the load right on me (You put the load right on me)

Crazy Chester followed me
And he caught me in the fog
He said, "I will fix your rack
If you'll take Jack, my dog"
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester
You know I'm a peaceful man"
He said, "That's okay, boy

Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
And (And, and)
You put the load right on me (You put the load right on me)

Catch a cannonball, now
To take me down the line
My bag is sinkin' low
And I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny
You know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her
Regards for everyone

Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
And (And, and)
You put the load right on me (You put the load right on me)
