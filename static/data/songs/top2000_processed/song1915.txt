Never Going Back Again - Fleetwood Mac

She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I'd been

Been down one time
Been down two times
I'm never going back again
Mmm


Mmm, you don't know what it means to win
Come 'round and see me again

Been down one time
Been down two times
Mmm, I'm never going back again
Mmm
