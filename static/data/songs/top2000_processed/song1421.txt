Eternal Flame - The Bangles

Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?

I believe it's meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning (Burning) an eternal (Eternal) flame?

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain
I don't wanna lose this feelin', oh

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then come and ease the pain

Close your eyes, give me your hand
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning an eternal flame?

Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreamin'? Ah

Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand? (Do you understand?)
