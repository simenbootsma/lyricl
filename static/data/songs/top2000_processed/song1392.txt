Let Love Rule - Lenny Kravitz

Love is gentle as a rose
And love can conquer any war
It's time to take a stand
Brothers and sisters join hands

We got to let love rule
(Let love rule)
We got to let love rule
(Let love rule)

Love transcends all space and time
And love can make a little child smile
A-can't you see?
This won't go wrong
Oh, but we got to be strong
We can't do it alone

We got to let love rule
(Let love rule)
We got to let love rule

(Let love rule)
You got to, got to, got to
(Let love rule) Let love rule
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, yeah
You got to, got to, got to, yeah
(Let love rule) Let, let, let, let love rule
Let love rule
Ha, woo
(Let love rule) Let love rule
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You got to, got to, got to

Yes, yeah, yeah
Dee-bee-lee-bee-bip-mmm-bip-mmm, baby, yeah, yeah
You got to, yeah
Whee
You got to
Got to, got to, got to, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let love rule
