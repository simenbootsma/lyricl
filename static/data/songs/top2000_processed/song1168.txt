Welcome To The DCC - Nothing But Thieves

Welcome to the DCC
Dead Club City
Wake up in the DCC
Dead Club City
All the heaven, all the time
If you dream it, you can have it
If you believe it, it can happen
Welcome to the DCC
Dead Club City
Live your perfect life
Welcome to the—
(Welcome to the—)

We got problems
See them gather on the shore
Empty promise
Can't say nothin' anymore
I been shoutin'
I been shoutin' down a hole, hello?
Watch and repeat
Saw your heaven in between
Come and get me
I'm so ready to begin
I been hopin'

Welcome to the DCC
Dead Club City
You can live your perfect life
Wake up in the DCC
Dead Club City
All the heaven, all the time, oh

Sunlit upland
, a new planet
Enjoy the feelin', let it happen
If you dream it, you can have it
If you believe it, it can happen
It can happen, oh

(Welcome to the DCC)
We've got the feelings that you want
Peace, love, and understanding
We've got the feelings that you need
Take back control, be happy
(Happy, happy)
(Welcome to the DCC)
(Happy)

Welcome to the DCC
Dead Club City
You can live your perfect life
Wake up in the DCC
Dead Club City
All the heaven, all the time
