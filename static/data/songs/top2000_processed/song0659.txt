Always  - Bon Jovi

This Romeo is bleedin'
, but you can't see his blood
It's nothin' but some feelin's that this old dog kicked up
It's been rainin' since you left me, now I'm drownin' in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter, but without you, I give up

I can't sing a love song like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore, but baby, that's just me

Yeah, I will love you, baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day
Always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I love you
Always

Now your pictures that you left behind are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry, one that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair, to touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needin' to hear
I'll wish I was him, 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'til the end of time

And I will love you, baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day
Always

If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face, there's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you


Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice
But, baby, if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives

Yeah, I will love you, baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day
Always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you
Always
Always

Oh, baby, don't you throw it away
Baby, don't you throw it away
Oh, baby, don't you throw it away, yeah, yeah
Come on
Away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
