If You Could See Me Now - The Script

(Oh, if you could see me now)
(Oh, if you could see me now)

It was February 14, Valentine's Day
The roses came, but they took you away
Tattooed on my arm is a charm
to disarm all the harm
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
And I'll never get to show you these songs
Dad, you should see the tours that I'm on
I see you standing there next to Mum
Both singing along, yeah, arm in arm
And there are days when I'm losing my faith
Because the man wasn't good, he was great
He'd say, "Music was the home for your pain"
And explain, I was young, he would say
"Take that rage, put it on a page
Take the page to the stage
Blow the roof off the place"
I'm tryna make you proud
Do everything you did
I hope you're up there with God
Saying, "That's my kid"

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh, if you could see me now
(Oh, if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh, if you could see me now

(Oh, if you could see me now)
Yeah

If you could see me now, would you recognise me?
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticise me?
Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face
Put your hand on a heart that was cold as the day you were taken away?
I know it's been a while but I could see you clear as day
Right now, I wish I could hear you say
I drink too much and I smoke too much Dutch
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must
You used to say I won't know a winner till it crossed me
Like I won't know real love till I've loved then I've lost it
So if you've lost a sister, someone's lost a mum
And if you've lost a dad, then someone's lost a son
And they're all missing now, and they're all missing now
So if you get a second to look down at me now
Mum, Dad, I'm just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh, if you could see me now
(Oh, if you could see me now)
If you could see me now
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh, if you could see me now

(Oh, oh)
Ooh, would you call me a saint or a sinner?
Would you love me a loser or a winner? Ooh
(Oh, oh)
When I see my face in the mirror
We look so alike that it makes me shiver

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh, if you could see me now
(Oh, if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh, if you could see me now
(Oh, if you could see me now)
(Yeah, I'm just missing you now)
I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh, if you could see me now
(Oh, if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh, if you could see me now
(Oh, if you could see me now)
Oh, oh, oh

(If you could see, you could see me now)
(You could see, you could see me now)
