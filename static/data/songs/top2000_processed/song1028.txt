Hard Sun - Eddie Vedder

When I walk beside her
I am the better man
When I look to leave her
I always stagger back again
Once I built an ivory tower
So I could worship from above
When I climb down to be set free
She took me in again

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard world

When she comes to greet me
She is mercy at my feet
And I, I see her inner charm
She just throws it back at me
Once I dug an early grave
To find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard world
Oh, there's a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard world

When I go to cross that river
She is comfort by my side
When I try to understand
She just opens up her hands

Ah, ah
Ah-Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ahhhhhh

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people

Once I stood to lose her
When I saw what I had done
Bowed down and threw away the hours
Of her garden and her sun
So I tried to warn her
I turned to see her weep
Forty days and forty nights
And it's still coming down on me

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard world
Oh, there's a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard world
Oh, there's a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard worldOh, there's a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard world
There's a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard world
Oh, there's a big
A big hard sun
Beating on the big people
In a big hard world
