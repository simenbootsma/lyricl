I'm Not So Tough - Ilse Delange

I can almost read your mind
It's running fast, out of control
You're afraid of what you'll find if you get too close
You imagine I don't care
You see walls that just aren't there
You think I'm too strong to let you in
Well, that's just not fair

I'm not so tough, I'll call your bluff
And let you see a side of me
That wants you here and cries real tears
And needs someone to love
I'm not so tough

I know that you've been hurt before
Well, so have I, what can you do?
That doesn't mean you close the door
So stop blaming me, I don't blame you
I'm not some ghost from your past
The one who tore your heart in half
I'm not her, it's not my fault you're holding on to that

I'm not so tough, I'll call your bluff
And let you see a side of me
That wants you here and cries real tears
And needs someone to love


I'm not so tough, I'll call your bluff
And let you see a side of me
That wants you here and cries real tears
And needs someone to love
I'm not so tough
I'm not so tough, I'll call your bluff
And let you see a side of me
That wants you here and cries real tears
And needs someone to love
I'm not so tough
