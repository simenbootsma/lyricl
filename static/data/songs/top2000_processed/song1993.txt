Grace - Jeff Buckley

There's the moon asking to stay
Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
Well it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die
My fading voice sings of love
But she cries to the clicking of time, oh, time

Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Fire

And she weeps on my arm
Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
Oh drink a bit of wine, we both might go tomorrow, oh my love
And the rain is falling and I believe my time has come
It reminds me of the pain I might leave, leave behind

Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Fire

(It reminds me of the pain)
I might leave, leave behind

And I feel them drown my name
So easy to know and forget with this kiss
And I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow
Oh, oh, yeah

Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Oh, oh, oh, yeah-yeah
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Oh, wait, wait, wait
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Hey, wait
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
