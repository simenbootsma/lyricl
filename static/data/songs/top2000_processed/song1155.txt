Dreams - The Cranberries

Oh, my life
Is changin' every day
In every possible way
And oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
Never quite as it seems

I know I've felt like this before
But now I'm feelin' it even more
Because it came from you
Then I open up and see
The person fallin' here is me
A different way to be

Ah
La-ah-ya-ah
La-ya-ya
La-ah-ya-ah
Ya-ah, ah, ah

I want more
Impossible to ignore
Impossible to ignore
And they'll come true
Impossible not to do

And now I tell you openly
You have my heart, so don't hurt me
You're what I couldn't find
Totally amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me

Oh, my life
Is changin' every day
In every possible way
And oh, my dreams
It's never quite as it seems
'Cause you're a dream to me, dream to me

Ah, la-a-la-ah, la la la
La-a-la-ah, la-ah ah ah
Ah, la-a-la-ah, la la la
La-a-la-ah, la-ah ah ah
