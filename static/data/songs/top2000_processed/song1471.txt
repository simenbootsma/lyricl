Pressure Makes Diamonds  - Danny Vera

Pressure makes diamonds, not silver or gold
It breaks to pieces the hardest of stone
And it shines brighter than the stars that you know
Pressure makes diamonds and hard work pays off
Pressure makes diamonds, no giant can hold
He thought he could carry this world on his own
But even the strongest can't do it alone
'Cause pressure makes diamonds and hard work pays off

You have to sharpen the edges, smoothen the surface
It'll take you some time 'cause it's rough and it's tough
Then you'll find what you're looking for
Appearing like a falling star
Shake off the dirt and let it shine

Pressure makes diamonds, a long heavy road
First the weight on your shoulders, it's crushing your bones
And then it gets darker than the blackest of coal
'Cause pressure makes diamonds and hard work pays off

You have to sharpen the edges, smoothen the surface
It'll take you some time 'cause it's rough and it's tough
Then you'll find what you're looking for
Appearing like a falling star

Pressure makes diamonds, not silver or gold
It breaks to pieces the hardest of stone
And it shines brighter than the stars that you know
'Cause pressure makes diamonds and hard work pays off
Pressure makes diamonds and hard work pays off
