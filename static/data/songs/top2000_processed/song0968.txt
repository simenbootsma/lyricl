Times Are Changing - DI-RECT

Everybody's in a separate zone
All together, but we're so alone
Staring out through a wall of glass
Look away, 'cause it's gonna crash

And oh, my heart is open
Oh, the times are changing
Forever
Forever

Put a picture in a golden frame
But in the end it will be the same
Chains are broken and my eyes are wide
It feels so good just to be alive

And oh, my heart is open
Oh, the times are changing
Forever
Forever

I could wait until the day I die
For something real that I can't deny
Gonna give myself a fighting chance

Oh, the times are changing
Oh, my heart is open
Oh, the times are changing
Oh, the times are changing
Forever
Forever
Forever
