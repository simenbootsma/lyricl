Not An Addict - K's Choice
Hmm ah, hmmm ah, hmmm ah, hmmm ah, hmmm ah, hmmm ah, hmmm ah hmmm ah hmmm ah, hmmm ah, hmmm ah, hmmm ah, hmmm ah, hmmm ah

Breathe it in and breathe it out
And pass it on, it's almost out
We're so creative, so much more
We're high above but on the floor

It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
If you don't have it you're on the other side

The deeper you stick it in your vein
The deeper the thoughts, there's no more pain
I'm in heaven, I'm a god
I'm everywhere, I feel so hot

It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
If you don't have it you're on the other side
I'm not an addict (maybe that's a lie)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)

It's over now, I'm cold, alone
I'm just a person on my own
Nothing means a thing to me

It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
If you don't have it you're on the other side
I'm not an addict (maybe that's a lie)

Free me, leave me
Watch me as I'm going down
Free me, see me
Look at me, I'm falling and I'm falling

It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive, I feel
It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
If you don't have it you're on the other side

It's not a habit, it's cool, I feel alive
If you don't have it you're on the other side
I'm not an addict (maybe that's a lie)

I'm not an addict
I'm not an addict
I'm not an addict
I'm not an addict
