Summertime - Brainbox
Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumping
And the cotton's high
Your daddy's rich
And your mom is good lookin'
So hush, little baby
Don't you cry
One of these mornings
You're gonna rise up singin'
You're gonna spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
Until that morning
There ain't nothing gonna harm you
With daddy and mummy standing by
