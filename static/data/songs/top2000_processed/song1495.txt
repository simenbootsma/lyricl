Up Around The Bend - Creedence Clearwater Revival

There's a place up ahead, and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Ooh!

Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Ooh!

You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Yeah!

Ooh!

Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead, and I'm goin'
Come along, come along with me

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Yeah!

Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo, hmm
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo-doo, yeah
Doo, doo, doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, all right
