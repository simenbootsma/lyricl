How Soon Is Now? - The Smiths


I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that was criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved


There's a club if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry
And you want to die


When you say, "It's gonna happen now"
Well, when exactly do you mean?
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone


You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
