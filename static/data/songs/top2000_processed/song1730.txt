Times Were When - The Cats
Granddad's sitting by the fire
Reminiscing of the times when he was a boy
In the good old days he keeps on saying
But everything I've heard before
Times were when, times were when
Times that won't be back again
Times were when
Times were when boys looked like provo's
And the daddies said "Act ever like you are mature"
He doesn't understand our generation
And in it he can see no good
Times were when, times were when
Times that won't be back again
Times were when
But when I get to his age
I will talk of all the good times I have today
Times were when he was a young man
And he fawled and did the same things I do today
Times were when, times were when
Times that won't be back again
Times were whenTimes were when, times were when
Times that won't be back again
Times were when
