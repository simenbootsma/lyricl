Invisible Touch - Genesis

Well, I've been waiting
Waiting here so long
But thinking nothing
Nothing could go wrong
Ooh now I know

She has a built-in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I'm falling
Falling for her

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

Well, I don't really know her
I only know her name
Ooh, but she crawls under your skin
You're never quite the same
And now I know

She's got something you just can't trust
An' it's something mysterious
And now it seems I'm falling
Falling for her

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart


She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

Well, she don't like losing
To her, it's still a game
And though she will mess up your life
You'll want her just the same

She has a built-in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I've fallen
Fallen for her

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She reaches in and grabs right hold of your heart
She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart
