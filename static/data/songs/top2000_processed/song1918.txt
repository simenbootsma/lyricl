The Wild Places - Duncan Browne

A prima donna slipped into her leather
But she was restless, she knew it in her heart of hearts
She said, "Tonight you'd better pull yourself together
Because tonight I'm gonna pull myself apart"
Out on the streets, everyone is searchin' for a thrill
But she's the only one that's out there really dressed to kill
And she said, "Listen to me, it's not a tragedy
This time I'm gettin' through and now there's something you can do for me

And oh, oh, take me to the wild places
And let me show you what the night is for
And I don't wanna dream, I wanna set the wheels in motion
I don't wanna see your eyes across a dancin' floor"

TV angel with her eyes full of smoke
Gazin' at the hero, he's so mucho macho
He shrugs, he says, "This must be some kind of joke"
As she pulls on his cigarette and loves him to distraction
But she cries, "I don't wanna feel like a machine
I'm not the only one who wants to feel the in-between
That's why I'm deep into this fatal fascination

And oh, oh, take me to the wild places
If you wanna see what's really in my soul
But you'd better keep your eye on where my pretty face is
'Cause in the heat of the moment I just lose control
In the heat of the moment, I just lose control"

Eyes out of focus, the sharpening of blades
The sad tension, reek of patchouli
Even the jokers are dealin' in spades
It's one dimension, it's all so pass√©
Just then a voice said, "Honey, it's too late to change your mind"
Her face tightened, I could see she'd found a new design
And she said, "Listen to me, it's just a fantasy
This time I'm gettin' through and now there's something you can do for me

And oh, oh, take me to the wild places
And let me show you what the night is for
'Cause I don't wanna dream, I wanna set the wheels in motion
I wanna see your eyes across a dancin' floor
Ooh, lovers set the wheels in motion
Ooh, lovers set the wheels in motion
Ooh, lovers set the wheels in motion
In the heat of the moment, I just lose control
