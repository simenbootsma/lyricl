Devil Don't Care - DI-RECT


Fix my make-up on the way
In the rearview-mirror of my daddies car
I'm a bad boy rebel, baby born to lose
And I kinda like it
I kinda like it

Tears are running down my face
Burn that rubber like my memories
I'm a daredevil, don't blink, I break the rules
And I kinda like it
I kinda like it

It will be easier
When the past is gone
The only way to go
Is the one you're on
You will never exist again
You will never exist again

'Cause the devil don't care
The devil don't mind
The devil don't care

85 on a 70
Don't you wanna live your life in ecstasy?
I ran before I paid my dues
And I kinda like it, and so do you

No one's watching
We will never be found
Never be found
Bridges burning
We won't ever turn around
Never turn around

It will be easier
When the past is gone
The only way to go
Is the one you're on
You will never exist again
You will never exist again
You will never exist again

'Cause the devil don't care
The devil don't mind
The devil don't care
The devil don't mind
'Cause I'm not
'Cause the devil don't care
(Doesn't care)
(Doesn't mind)
(Doesn't care)
The devil don't care
(Doesn't care)
(Doesn't mind)
(Doesn't care)
'Cause the devil don't care
