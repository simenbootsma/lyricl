The Wild Rover  - The Dubliners
Verse 1
I've been a wild rover for many's a year
I spent all my money on whiskey and beer
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
And I never will play the wild rover no more
Chorus:
And it's no, nay never
No nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more
Verse 2
I went into an alehouse I used to frequent
And I told the landlady me money was spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me nay
Such a custom as yours I can have any day
Chorus:
And it's no, nay never
No nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more
Verse 3
I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
She said, "I have whiskey and wines of the best
And the words that you told me were only in jestChorus:
And it's no, nay never
No nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more
Verse 4
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And if they caress me as oft times before
Then I never will play the wild rover no more
Chorus:
And it's no, nay never
No nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more
And it's no, nay never
No nay never no more
Will I play the wild rover
No never no more
