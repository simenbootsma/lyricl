How My Heart Was Won - DI-RECT

Watch as the night turns to noon
Bring back the day I met you
Returning to our sweet cocoon
Felt like we were dreaming
Right from the start my guard was down
You walked in and turned my life around
You weed out the seeds of doubt
Oh, our love growing deep inside

Begging you to stay
Who cared that we got carried away?
Our struggles just steadied our aim
There's no paradise without sacrifice
We'd end up on the same side
You're so strong
This is how my heart was won

Wondering who's right or wrong
It just makes you feel so alone
I don't want to be on my own
Will you be my hero?

Begging you to stay
Who carеd that we got carried away?
Our struggles just stеadied our aim
There's no paradise without sacrifice
We'd end up on the same side
You're so strong
This is how my heart was won

Remember the pain and the same conversations
Nothing seemed to change what was said and done
See the sweet little wonders that we have created
Our love line still grows in our palm
Oh, we never let go
And this is how my heart was won
