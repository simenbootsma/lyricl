A Winter's Tale - Queen

It's winter fall
Red skies are gleamin'
Oh!
Seagulls are flyin' over
Swans are floatin' by
Smokin' chimney tops
Am I dreamin'?
Am I dreamin'?

The nights draw in
There's a silky moon up in the sky
Yeah!
Children are fantasizin'
Grown-ups are standin' by
What a super feelin'
Am I dreamin'?
Am I dreamin'?
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

(Dreaming) So quiet and peaceful
(Dreaming) Tranquil and blissful
(Dreaming) There's a kind of magic in the air
(Dreaming) What a truly magnificent view
(Dreaming) A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world


(Dreaming) A cozy fireside chat
(Dreaming) A little this, a little that
(Dreaming) Sound of merry laughter skippin' by
(Dreaming) Gentle rain beatin' on my face!
(Dreaming) What an extraordinary place!
And the dream of the child
Is the hope of the, hope of the man!

It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky
Yeah!
Mountains are zoomin' higher, uh
Little girls scream and cry
My world is spinnin', and spinnin', and spinnin'
It's unbelievable
Sends me reeling
Am I dreamin'?
Am I dreamin'?

Ooh, it's bliss
