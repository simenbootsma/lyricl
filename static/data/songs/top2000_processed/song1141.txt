Little Wing - Jimi Hendrix
(Originally performed by Jimi Hendrix)
Well shes walking through the clouds
With a circus mind thats running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams and fairy tales
Thats all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind
When Im sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles, she gives to me free
Its alright she says its alright
Take anything you want from me, anything
Anything
Fly on little wing
Yeah yeah, yeah, little wing
