Glory Days - Bruce Springsteen

Oh yeah
C'mon
Wooh
Huh

I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool, boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days
Well they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days (Alright)

Well, there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school, she could turn all the boys' heads
Sometimes on a Friday, I'll stop by and have a few drinks
After she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband, Bobby, well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times

Glory days
Yeah, they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days (Rock it now)

My old man worked twenty years on the line
And they let him go
Now everywhere he goes out looking for work
They just tell him that he's too old
I was nine-years old and he was working
At the Metuchen Ford plant
assembly line
Now he just sits on a stool down at the Legion Hall
But I can tell what's on his mind

Glory days
Yeah, goin' back, glory days
Aw, he ain't never had glory days
Glory days

I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm gonna drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will
Yeah, just sitting back, trying to recapture
A little of the glory, yeah
Well, time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister

Glory days
Yeah, they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days

Glory days
Yeah, they'll pass you by, glory days
In the wink of a young girl's eye, glory days
Glory days

Well, alright, ooh yeah
Well, alright, (Alright) come on now (oh, yeah)
Well, alright (Alright), ooh yeah (oh, yeah)
Alright, (Alright) come on now (oh, yeah)
Wooh, yeah (Alright), wooh yeah (oh yeah)
Wooh, yeah (Ooh)
Alright boys, keep a-rockin' now
Keep on goin'

Bring it home, yeah
Bring it home, oh oh
Alright, well alright
Well, alright, well alright
Well, alright, well alright
Alright, alright
Let's go
Woo
