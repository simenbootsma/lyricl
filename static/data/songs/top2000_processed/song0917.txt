Get Back - The Beatles

Rosetta...
Sweet Loretta Fart she thought she was a cleaner
But she was a frying pan
Sweet Rosetta Martin... Rosetta
The picker, the picker, picture the fingers burning
Ooh
Okay

Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged


Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back
, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Oh, get back, yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back
Ooh
Thanks, Mo
I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves
And I hope we passed the audition
