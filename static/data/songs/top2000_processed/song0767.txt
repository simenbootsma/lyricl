Colors - Black Pumas

I woke up to the morning sky first
Baby blue, just like we rehearsed
When I get up off this ground, I shake leaves back down
To the brown, brown, brown, brown 'til I’m clean
Then I walked where I'd be shaded by the trees
By a meadow of green
For about a mile
I'm headed to town, town, town in style

With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
All my favorite colors, right on
My sisters and my brothers see ’em like no other
All my favorite colors

It's a good day to be, a good day for me
A good day to see my favorite colors, colors
My sisters and my brothers, they see 'em like no other
All my favorite colors

Now take me to the other side
Little bitty blues birds fly
In gray clouds, or white walls, or blue skies
We gon' fly, feel alright
And we gon', ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah
They sound like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
, yeah
And the least I can say, I anticipate
A homecome parade as we renegade in the morning

With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
All my favorite colors, yes, ma'am
My sisters and my brothers see 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
Ha, oh

Closer, ooh
Love machine

All my favorite colors, right
All my favorite colors, yes, ma'am
My sisters and my brothers see ’em like no other
All my favorite colors

It’s a good day to be, a good day for me
A good day to see my favorite colors, colors
My sisters and my brothers, they see 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
