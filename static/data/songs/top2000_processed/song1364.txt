Farewell To The Fairground - White Lies

The light still in our eyes
We're leaving this whole fairground behind
It's a dream that's growing cold
The circus never dies
The act forever haunts these skies
I know we cannot stay

Farewell to the fairground
These rides aren't working anymore
Goodbye to this dead town
Until the ice begins to thaw

This place used to gleam
I'd see it in my hopeful dreams
Now I have to get away
We move towards the stars
And all that we touch becomes ours
Let's keep warm till it's day

Farewell to the fairground
These rides aren't working anymore
Goodbye to this dead town

We'll head south, just hold my hand now
I feel like I'm casting off my clothes
And I'm running through the snow
Towards the sunset
And I'm always with you

Keep on running
Keep, keep on running
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
Keep on running
Keep, keep on running
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
Keep on running
Keep, keep on running
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
Keep on running
Keep, keep on running
There's no place like home
There's no place like homeKeep on running
Keep, keep on running
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
Keep on running
Keep, keep on running
There's no place like home
There's no place like home

Farewell to the fairground
These rides aren't working anymore
Goodbye to this dead town
Until the ice begins to thaw

We'll head south, just hold my hand now
I feel like I'm casting off my clothes
And I'm running through the snow
Towards the sunset
And I'm always with you
