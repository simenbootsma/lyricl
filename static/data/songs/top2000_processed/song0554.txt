This Is The Life - Amy MacDonald

Oh, the wind whistles down the cold, dark street tonight
And the people, they were dancin' to the music vibe
And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
While the shy, tormented youth sit way over there
And the songs, they get louder, each one better than before

And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?

So you're headin' down the road in your taxi for four
And you're waitin' outside Jimmy's front door
But nobody's in, and nobody's home till four
So you're sittin' there with nothin' to do
Talkin' about Robert Riger and his motley crew

And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?


And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?

Where you gonna sleep tonight?
