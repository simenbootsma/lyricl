State Of Independence - Donna Summer
State of life
May I live
May I love
Coming out the sky
I name me a name
Coming out silver
Word for what it is
It is the very nature of the sound
The game

Shot to the soul
The flame of Oroladian
The essence of the word
The state of independenceSounds like a signal from you
Bring me to meet your sound
And I will bring you to my heart
Love, like a signal you call
Touching my body
My soul
Bring to me
You to meet me here
Home
Be the temple of your heart
Home
Be the body of your love
Just like holy water to my lips
Hey, hey
Yes
I do know how I survive
Yes
I do know why I'm alive
To love and be with you
Day by day, by day, by day
Time, time again
It is said
We will hear

See it all in His wisdom hearHis truth will abound the land
This truth will abound the land
This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be
