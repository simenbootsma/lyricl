Is She Really Going Out With Him?  - Joe Jackson

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Now that is probably the worst singing I've ever heard in my life
Ooh, ooh
Everybody
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window, I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (Where?)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
If my eyes don't deceive me
There's somеthing going wrong around here

Tonight's the night whеn I go to all the parties down my street
So I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there (Where?)
There
They say that looks don't count for much

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
If my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here
Around, around, oh yeah

Here
Here
Go on around
Something, something, something
Something going, something going, something going
Something going, something going
Something, something, something
Something going on around

You know what's wrong with the music scene today?
There's not enough chaos
"Don't Wanna Be Like That"
One, two, three, four
