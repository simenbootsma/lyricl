Gaia - Valensia
I guess we all believe and pray in a different way
I know He has many names
I'm sure that—all in all—it stays the same
All comes out one day
We're all afraid that day might not be so far away
If we want to live here and stay
Better not let Gaia wash us away
She's got rules we must obey
(The World has always judged itself)
(When it comes to crimes, I know)
(Who is going to judge the earth)
(When a crime has been done by the world)
(All by the world itself, yeah)
I know you still dream of harmony
And I guess I'll just dream on with you
We're nothing but a lonely crowd
Gaia, Gaia, where do we go?
Why do you go, and leave me alone?
Gaia, Gaia, I want you to know
I couldn't save you all on my own
Gaia
Bury us all under iceWorld, calm down, take five
'Cause you lost the meaning of life
So many ways to survive
Millions of chances, more than meets the eye
Life could be so nice (Hear the bird of Greenpeace sing)
We're so far we even can't wage a war no more
Even the moon would be gone
Who would be left over to say, we won
Back, to where it all began
(The World has always judged itself)
(When it comes to crimes, I know)
(Who is going to judge the earth)
(When a crime has been done by the world)
(All by the world itself, yeah)
I know you still dream of harmony
And I guess I'll just dream on with you
We're nothing but a lonely crowd
Gaia, Gaia, where do we go?
Why do you go, and leave me alone?
Gaia, Gaia, I want you to know
I couldn't save you all on my own
Gaia (Gaia)
Bury us all under ice(Bomb and dumb is 'going to die')
(All living on a lie)
(The rub-a-dub into the night)
(Who is going to live? Who is going to die?)
I know you still dream of harmony
And I guess I'll just dream on with you
We're nothing but a lonely crowd
Gaia, Gaia, where do we go?
Why do you go, and leave me alone?
Gaia, Gaia, I want you to know
I couldn't save you all on my own
(All on my own)
Gaia, Gaia, I want you to know
I couldn't save you all on my own
Gaia, Gaia
Bury us all under ice
Our youth has a few words to say
Maybe they know we wiped their future away
Could be they've got nothing to say
Maybe they don't know whether they are gonna stay, or not
I know they've got one thing to say
We all want a better place, but Gaia let it go, let it go...(And we all want a better place, but Gaia let it go)
Whatever we do, chances are few
Every way leads to heaven
(And we all want a better place, but Gaia let it go)
Whatever we do, chances are few
Every way leads to heaven
(And we all want a better place, but Gaia let it go)
Whatever we do, chances are few
We need a hand from above
Oh oh, Gaia... (What are we living for?)
Oh oh, Gaia... (What are we living for?)
She is going to die
Unless...
