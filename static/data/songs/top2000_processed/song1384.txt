Rockin' All Over The World - Status Quo

Oh, here we are and here we are and here we go
All aboard and we're hittin' the road
Here we go, rockin' all over the world
A giddy up and giddy up and get away
We're goin' crazy and we're goin' today
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

I'm gonna tell your mama what you're gonna do
So come on out with your dancing shoes
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like
Here we go, rockin' all over the world
And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like
Here we go, rockin' all over the world
And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like
Here we go, rockin' all over the world
And I like it, I like it, I like it, I like it
I li-li-like it, li-li-like
Here we go, rockin' all over the world
