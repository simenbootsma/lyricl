Speed Of Light - Chef'Special

I got real tears running down my face
I got real fears waiting to be faced
But I'm still here, it's another day and I'm still here
I got blue skies open up above me
Let me hold you tight, tell me that you love me
It's a new life, oh, nothing's ever felt more real

Hold me close, crazy life
I'm living at the speed of light
Time and grace surround me
As I sit and wonder why
Don't let go, crazy life
I'm living at the speed of life
Don't forgеt about me
Before wе get to say goodbye

You go faster than I run
Faster than I fall or fly, oh, faster than I want
I look around and realize that you're the only one
Hmm, yeah, you're the only one
And I'm on my knees looking for meaning
Looking for something that's real
I got someone to love me and I just started to feel

Hold me close
I'm like a star shooting cross the sky
Don't forget about me
Before we say goodbye

Hold me close, crazy life
I'm living at the speed of light
Time and grace surround me
As I sit and wonder why, oh
Don't let go, crazy life
I'm living at the speed of life
Don't forget about me
Before we get to say goodbye

I'm going faster than I want to
Going faster than I want to
Let me love you 'cause you're the only one
I'm going faster than I want to
Going faster than I want to
Let me love you 'cause you're the only one

I got real tears running down my face
I got real fears waiting to be faced
But I'm still here, still here
