I Don't Want To Miss A Thing  - Aerosmith

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'
While you're far away and dreamin'
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lyin' close to you, feelin' your heart beatin'
And I'm wonderin' what you're dreamin'
Wonderin' if it's me you're seein'
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
Well, I just wanna be with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just wanna hold you close
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah

Don't wanna close my eyes
Don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep, yeah
