Bigmouth Strikes Again - The Smiths

Sweetness, sweetness
I was only joking when I said
I'd like to smash every tooth in your head
Oh-oh, sweetness, sweetness
I was only joking when I said
By rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt (Ah)

Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da
Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race, oh, oh, oh-oh
Bigmouth la-da-da-da-da
Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt (Oh-oh-oh)
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt (Ah)

Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Bigmouth, oh-oh-oh, ha-ha
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Bigmouth, oh-oh-oh, ha-ha
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race, oh, no, no, no, no, no
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race, oh, oh, no, no, no
