Trouble - Coldplay

Oh no, I see
A spiderweb is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

Oh no, what's this?
A spiderweb, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Oh no, I see
A spiderweb, and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

Singin' that I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble

They spun a web for me
And they spun a web for me
And they spun a web for me
