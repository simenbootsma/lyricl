Everybody Needs Somebody To Love - The Blues Brothers

We’re so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight
And we would especially like to welcome all of the representatives of the Illinois Law enforcement community, who have chosen to join us here in the Palace Hotel Ballroom at this time
We do sincerely hope that you all enjoy the show and please remember people, that no matter who you are and what you do to live, thrive and survive
There are still some things that make us all the same:
You, me, them
Everybody! Everybody!

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love
Someone to love (Someone to love)
Sweetheart to miss (Sweetheart to miss)
Sugar to kiss (Sugar to kiss)
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you in the morning
You, you, you when my soul’s on fire

Sometimes I feel
I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me, I never never have a place to hide, I need you!

Sometimes I feel
I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me, I never never have a place to hide, I need you!
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you
I need you, (you) you, you

You know, people, when you do find somebody
Hold that woman, hold that man
Love him, please him, squeeze her, please her
Hold, squeeze and please that person, give 'em all your love
Signify your feelings with every gentle caress
Because it’s so important to have that special somebody
To hold kiss, miss, squeeze, and please

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody to love (Everybody)
Someone to love (Needs somebody)
Sweetheart to miss (Everybody)

I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
In the morning
When my soul’s on fire
When there ain't no one around

I need you, you, you, you
I need you, you, you, you
I need you, you
I need you!
