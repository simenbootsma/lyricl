Tougher Than The Rest - Bruce Springsteen

Well, it's Saturday night
You're all dressed up in blue
I been watching you a while
Maybe you been watching me, too
So somebody ran out
Left somebody's heart in a mess
Well, if you're looking for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest

Some girls, they want a handsome Dan
Or some good-lookin' Joe
On their arm, some girls
Like a sweet-talkin' Romeo
Well, round here, baby
I learned you get what you can get
So if you're rough enough for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest

The road is dark and it's a thin, thin line
But I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time
Maybe your other boyfriends couldn't pass the test
Well, if you're rough and ready for love

Well, it ain't no secret
I've been around a time or two
Well, I don't know, baby
Maybe you've been around too
Well, there's another dance
All you gotta do is say yes
And if you're rough and ready for love
Honey, I'm tougher than the rest

If you're rough enough for love
Baby, I'm tougher than the rest
