Mr. Jones - Counting Crows

Sha-la-la-la, la-la-la
Mm, uh-huh

I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know, she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning
Sha-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah
Cut up, Maria
Show me some of them Spanish dances and
Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me
Help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes

Mr. Jones and me
Tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at them beautiful women
She's looking at you
Oh no, no, she's looking at me
Smiling in the bright lights
Coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you
You can never be lonely

Well, I'm gon' paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red, and black, and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me
Look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's looking at you
I don't think so, she's looking at me
Standing in the spotlight
I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me

I will never be lonely
Said, I'm never gonna be lonely

I wanna be a lion
Yeah, everybody wanna pass as cats
We all wanna be big, big stars
Yeah, but we got different reasons for that
Believe in me
'Cause I don't believe in anything
And I, I wanna be someone to believe
To believe, to believe, yeah

Mr. Jones and me
Stumbling through the barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
She's perfect for you
Man, there's got to be somebody for me
I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone
Just a little more funky
When everybody loves you
Oh son, that's just about as funky as you can be
Mr. Jones and me
Staring at the video
When I look at the television, I wanna see me
Staring right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we don't know why and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me

Mr. Jones and me
We're gonna be big stars
