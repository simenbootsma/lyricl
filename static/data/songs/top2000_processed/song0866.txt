In The Dutch Mountains - Nits
I was born in a valley of bricks
Where the river runs high above the rooftops
I was waiting for the cars coming home late at night
From the Dutch mountains
I was standing in a valley of rock
Up to my belly in an early fog
I was looking for the road to a green painted house
In the Dutch mountains
In the Dutch mountains
Mountains
Met a woman in a valley of stone
She was painting roses on the walls of her home
And the moon is a coin with the head of the queen
Of the Dutch mountains
In the Dutch mountains
I lost a button of my shirt today
It fell on the ground and it was rolling away
Like a trail leading me back
To the Dutch mountains
To the Dutch mountains
Mountains
Met a miller on the back of a cow
He was looking for the wind
But he didn't know how
I said: "Follow the cloud that looks like a sheep"
In the Dutch mountains
In the Dutch mountains
In the Dutch mountains
