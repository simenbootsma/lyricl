Ain't No Mountain High Enough - Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell

Listen, baby

Ain't no mountain high, ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby
If you need me, call me, no matter where you are
No matter how far, don't worry, baby
Just call my name, I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry, 'cause, baby, there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from gettin' to you, baby

Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me, darlin'
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me, someway, somehow
Oh, baby, there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough

Oh no, darlin'
No wind, no rain
Or winter's cold
Can stop me, baby (No, no, baby)
'Cause you are my goal
If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me, oh baby, ha

My love is alive (Woo), way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helpin' hand
I'll be there on the double just as fast as I can
Don't you know that there

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from gettin' to you, babe
Don't ya know that there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
