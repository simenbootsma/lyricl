Through The Echoes - Paolo Nutini

I'm always wondering what it would be like to die
She asks me, "Why?"
I always smile when I feel like I'm gonna cry
And she asked me, "Why?"
Over the cliff, and phantom sands
She's always offering me her hand
And I hear her coming

Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Straight to me
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over again

She's always wondering what it would feel like to fly
I ask her, "Why?"
She says evеrything that she sees shine is in the sky
Up thеre shining
When your belly's rumbling down the phone
When you ask for bread and get a stone
When you feel like you're alone

Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Straight to you
Listen for me coming through the echoes
Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Straight to you
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over again

Oh, yeah
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over again
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over again

Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Straight to you
Listen for me through the echoes
Through the echoes
Through the echoes
Straight to you
