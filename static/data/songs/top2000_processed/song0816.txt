Thunder - Imagine Dragons

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold,
have a seat
In the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder

Kids were laughin' in my classes
While I was schemin' for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smilin' from the stage while

Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder (Never give up, never give up)
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder (Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Never give up, never give up)

Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder (Woo)
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
