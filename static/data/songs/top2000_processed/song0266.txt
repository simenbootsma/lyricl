Das dj Paul Elstak, jonguh!
Ey, wa hoor ik daar nou, jonguh
I wanna see a rainbow high in the sky
I wanna see you and me
Hey, das een ander nummer

I wanna see the rainbow high in the sky
I wanna see you and me on a bird flying away
Then I hope to see your smile every night and day

Lead you to tomorrow
I wanna feel the sunshine after rain
We can reach out for the sky
No more rain and no more sorrow
