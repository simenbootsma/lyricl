Black Dog - Led Zeppelin


Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Ah, ah, child, way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, can't keep away

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flaming heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine, burning red
Dreams of you all through my head

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Hey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby
Darling, can't you do me now?
Hey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby
Move me while you do me now

Take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out
Spent my money, took my car
Started telling her friend she gonna be a star
I don't know, but I've been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

All I ask for, all I pray
Steady-rollin' woman gonna come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah
