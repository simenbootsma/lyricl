Love Really Hurts Without You - Billy Ocean

You run around town like a fool and you think that it's groovy
You're giving it to some other guy
Who gives you the eye
You don't give nothing to me
You painted a smile and you dress all the while to excite me
But don't you know you're turning me on?
I know that it's wrong
But I can't stop the pain inside me

Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do without you?

You walk like a dream and you make like you're queen of the action
You're using every trick in the book
The way that you look
You're really something to see
You cheat and you lie to impress any guy that you fancy
(Love really hurts without you)
But don't you know I'm out of my mind
So give me a sign

Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do without you?
Oh baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do without you?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
