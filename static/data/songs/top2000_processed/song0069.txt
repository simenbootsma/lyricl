Iron Sky  - Paolo Nutini

We are proud individuals
Living for the city
But the flames couldn’t go much higher
We find Gods and religions
To paint us with salvation
But no one, no nobody
Can give you, the power

To rise, over love
Over hate
Through this iron sky that’s fast becoming our mind
Over fear
and into freedom

Oh, that’s life
That’s dripping down the walls
Of a dream that cannot breathe
In this harsh reality
Mass confusion spoon fed to the blind
Serves now to define our cold society

From which we’ll rise, over love
Over hate
Through this iron sky that’s fast becoming our mind

You’ve just got to hold on
You’ve just got to hold on

“To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed. The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people and so long as men die, liberty will never perish. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You, the people, have the power to make this life. Free and beautiful. To make this life a wonderful adventure. Let us use that power - let us all unite!
”

And we’ll rise
Over love
Over hate
Through this iron sky that’s fast becoming our mind
Over fear and into freedom
Into freedom

From which we’ll rise, over love
Over hate
Through this iron sky that’s fast becoming our mind
Over fear and into
Freedom, freedom
From which we’ll rise, over love
Over hate
Through this iron sky that’s fast becoming our mind
Over fear and into freedom

Oh, rain on me
Rain on me
