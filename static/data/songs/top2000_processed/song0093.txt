Money For Nothing  - Dire Straits

I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV


Hah, now look at them yo-yos, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothing and your chicks for free
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup?
Yeah buddy, that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

Hoover, move-ah, huh

Got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
He's gotta move these refrigerators
Got to move these colour TVs
Look-ee here, look at it

I shoulda learned to play the guitar
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it sticking in the camera, man
Man, we could have some
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
He's banging on the bongos like a chimpanzee
Oh, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

*dog howling*

Listen here, now, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
