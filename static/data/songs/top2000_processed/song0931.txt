So Long - Fischer-Z

When I read your letter I coudn't believe that you'd gone
I dialled your number but no one answered the phone
I asked your friends to tell me if they knew where you were
They said they thought that you were ill
I hired a detective to try and find out where you are
He managed to trace you, he said, you're living in France
A watchman saw you climb into someone elses car
And drive off laughing in the night

Why didn't you tell me? Not leave me this way!
You could have told me, not waited for so long

I've tried to forget you, but I find myself walking the street
I went to the doctor and he gave me something to sleep
I sent you telegrams, but you haven't aswered one
Your mother told me I best leave you well alone
I hope you're satisfied now you've done this thing to me
I hope you're pleased with what you've done

Why didn't you tell me? Not leave me this way!

(For so long) I never realised just exactly who you are
(For so long) I never realised the girl I had before
(For so long) I hope you're satisfied; you won't hear from me again
(For so long) I hope you're pleased with what you've done

Why didn't you tell me? Not leave me this way!
You should have told me, not waited for so long...
