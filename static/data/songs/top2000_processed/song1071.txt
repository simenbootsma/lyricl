OMG It's Happening - DI-RECT

Carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home

Oh my God, it's happening
Close your eyes and feel again
You can choose to let it go
Embrace the inescapable

I'm on a highway to nowhere
Away from everyone
I wanna free-float in the ocean
Find me a wave to carry me home

And carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home
Carry me home

Separate and reunite
See you back on the other side
Don't try to bend it, let it break
Scream before you suffocate
Oh, oh my God, it's happening

I'm on a highway to nowhere
Away from everyone
I wanna free-float in the ocean
Find me a wave to carry me home

And carry me home
(It's happening, it's happening)
(It's happening, it's happening)
Oh my God, it's happening, it's happening
So carry me home
Carry me home
And carry me home
Floating away on my own
And carry me home
(Oh my God, it's happening)
Carry me home
(Close your eyes and feel again)
And carry me home
(Oh my God, it's happening)
And find me a wave to carry me home
And carry me home
