Luv U More - DJ Paul Elstak
You can make the sun turn purple
You can make the sea turn turtle
But you know you could never make
Me love you more
You can turn wine into water
Turn silence into laughter
But you know you could never make
Me love you more
Let the stars fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make
Me love you more
Let the rainwoods die
Let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make
Me love you more
You can make the sun turn purple
You can make the sea turn turtle
But you know you could never make
Me love you more
You can turn wine into water
And silence into laughter
But you know you could never make
Me love you moreLet the stars fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make
Me love you more
Let the rainwoods die
Let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make
Me love you more
Let the stars fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
So you know you can never make
Me love you more
Let the rainwoods die
Let the wells run dry
So you know you can never make
Me love you more
