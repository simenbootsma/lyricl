Whiskey In The Jar - Metallica

As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell, and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said, “Stand and deliver, or the devil, he may take you,”
yeah
I took all of his money, and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she loved me, no, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Bein' drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' money with me, but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven, yeah, in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols, and I shot him with both barrels, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah-heh, whiskey in the jar-o

Ohh yeah yeah, whoa-yo
Yeah, oh yeah

Now some men like the fishin', and some men like the fowlin'
And some men like to hear, to hear the cannonball a-roarin'
Me? I like sleepin', especially in Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da, yeah, yeah
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There’s whiskey in the jar-o, yeah
Whiskey in the jar-o, yeah

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Hey, musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da, yeah
