I Would Die 4 U - Prince & The Revolution

I'm not a woman, I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand
I'll never beat you, I never lie
And if you're evil, I'll forgive you by and by
, 'cause

You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me to
You, I would die for you

I'm not your lover, I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll never comprehend
No need to worry, no need to cry
I'm your Messiah, and you're the reason why, 'cause

You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me to
You, I would die for you, woo

You're just a sinner, I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad
I'm not a human
, I'm a dove
I'm your conscience, I am love

Yeah, I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me to
You, I would die for you
Yeah, say one more time
You, I would die for you
Darling, if you want me to
You, I would die for you
Two, three, four, you

I would die for you
I would die for you
You, I would die for you
You, I would die for you
