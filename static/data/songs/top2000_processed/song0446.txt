Diamonds - The Boxer Rebellion

Pretty little thing, did you feel something
Did you always want me to be something
To mend a broken heart
From a Devil of shallow nonsense
Turned your world upside down

What I ever said, did it mean something?
What I ever said, did it mean nothing?
And did I look the part?
When it's all said and done
When it's all said and done

I'm no good next to diamonds
When I'm too close they start to fade
Are you angry with me now?
Are you angry because I'm to blame?
I'm no good next to diamonds
When I'm too close they start to fade
Are you angry with me now?
Are you angry because I'm to blame?

Never wanna hide the truth from you
Just hang my head what I put you through
I wasn't good enough
When what's done is done love

(‘Cause I’m)
No good next to diamonds
When I'm too close they start to fade
Are you angry with me now?
Are you angry because I'm to blame?

Cause I'm far away
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was

I'm no good next to diamonds
When I'm too close they start to fade
Are you angry with me now?
Are you angry because I'm to blame?
I'm no good next to diamonds
When I'm too close they start to fade
Are you angry with me now?
Are you angry because I'm to blame?

Cause I'm far away
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
Further than I ever was
I have no words
