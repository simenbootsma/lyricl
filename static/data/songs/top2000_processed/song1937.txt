Need You Tonight - INXS

Come over here

All you got is this moment
Twenty-first century's yesterday
You can care all you want
Everybody does, yeah, that's okay

So slide over here and give me a moment
Your moves are so raw, I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
You're one of my kind
Ow
I need you tonight
'Cause I'm not sleepin'
There's something about you, girl
That makes me sweat

How do you feel? I'm lonely
What do you think? Can't think at all

So slide over here and give me a moment
Your moves are so raw, I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
You're one of my kind
Oh

'Cause I'm not sleepin', mm
There's something about you, girl
That makes me sweat

So how do you feel? I'm lonely
What do you think? Can't think at all
What'cha gonna do? Gonna live my life
How do you feel? I'm lonely
What do you think? Can't think at all

So slide over here and give me a moment
Your moves are so raw, I've got to let you know
