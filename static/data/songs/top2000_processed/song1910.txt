No Surrender - Kane
I was up, I was down
I felt almost everything
I was lost, been around
Still no hardly anything
Get my feet on the ground
And the heart of everything (It's just the way that I want it)
It's just the way that I want it
Like a shark, for the bait
You have been always waiting there
Everytime, just too late
Now at last you're standing there
What a fool what a shame
And the heart of everything (It's just the way that I want it)
It's just the way that I want it
Tonight's tonight
Time to leave the pressure behind
There's no surrender, no
In the heart, at the root
There's always something now
In disguise, understood
And the blame for someone else
The time I will find
Was the heart of everything (It's just the way that I want it)
It's just the way that I want itI don't know why
I guess it's just a matter of time
But there's no surrender, no , no surrender
It's just the way that I want it
Tonight's tonight
Time to leave the pressure behind
There's no surrender, no
There's no surrender, no
There's no surrender, no surrender
I was up, I was down
