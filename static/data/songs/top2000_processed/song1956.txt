Tonight, Tonight - Smashing Pumpkins


Time is never time at all
You can never ever leave
Without leaving a piece of youth
And our lives are forever changed
We will never be the same
The more you change, the less you feel

Believe, believe in me
Believe, believe

That life can change, that you're not stuck in vain
We're not the same, we're different
Tonight
Tonight, tonight, so bright
Tonight
Tonight

And you know you're never sure
But you're sure you could be right
If you held yourself up to the light
And the embers never fade
In your city by the lake

Believe, believe in me
Believe, believe

In the resolute urgency of now
And if you believe there's not a chance
Tonight
Tonight, tonight, so bright
Tonight, tonight

We'll crucify the insincere tonight
(Tonight)
We'll make things right, we'll feel it all tonight
(Tonight)
We'll find a way to offer up the night (Tonight)
The indescribable moments of your life (Tonight)
The impossible is possible tonight (Tonight)
Believe in me as I believe in you

Tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight
Tonight
