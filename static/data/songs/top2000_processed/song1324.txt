Kids - MGMT

Five, four, three, two, one, ah!

You were a child crawlin' on your knees toward it
Makin' Mama so proud,
but your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughin'
You pick the insects off plants,
no time to think of consequences

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

The water is warm, but it's sendin' me shivers
A baby is born, cryin' out for attention
The memories fade like lookin' through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it


Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees
