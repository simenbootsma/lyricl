Knocking On Heaven's Door - Guns N' Roses


Hello!
Yahtzee!
What's up Technicians and all others?
We in this muthafucka celebratin' X-Raided
His release, "It is up!"

I love it

Is it up?

Yeah it's...

Yeah I'm talkin' about is it up, though?

It's up, up, up
It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up
(Goin' down) ugh
It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up
(Goin' down) ugh
When It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, It's up
(Goin' down) ughPeople love to Monday morning quarterback
(Yeah)
On what you shoulda did
When you too scared to go outside
I live in the wilderness
Psychopaths live to kill
Everybody kill to live
I'm somewhere in the middle
Tryna build a bridge and fill the fridge
All I hear is squealin' pigs when peelin' wigs
Kill at will
So kids better chill, better get real
How do knees standin' still on your neck feel?
Completely disrespectful
Expect the flex, though
Fuck the world
I'm hyper-sexual
Got the sauce, that's extra special
Comin to collect dough
Comin to collect mo'
Comin' like corpse with the necro
Then i'm comin back like a echo
Check ready set go
I'ma be gross for the net, though
Plus he always got petro
Just can't hide the fact that I'm geto
All my niggas slime like ecto
Grab a Tec-9 play connect fo'
Zulu voodoo shoot through ya best bro
Thats neuter retro
Who blew your noodle?
Im who to google
They pseudo intellectual
Your crew is poodles
We futile retinal
Bring my own cordless mic to your next show

It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up
(Goin' down) ugh
It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up
(Goin' down) ugh
When It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, It's up
Ugh
What's up, nigga?
It's up, nigga!

I enter the atmosphere moving at 10,000 mph like a UAP
One of the dopest rappers on earth you never heard of
No matter who you may be
You’re only unaware due to censorship
All of your favorite rappers love my penmanship
It isn’t a coincidence that I’m from California
I am the Nimitz incident
, bitch!
I carry a semi-gun
Public Enemy, uzi weighs twenty tons
Advanced technology, my chronology originated from Area 51
Do you discern dark matters?
I had a collision at CERN
Have you ever had to choose between either jumping
Or making a decision to burn?
(Going down!)
In a 9/11
Porsche (in a Porsche)
My G is beyond 11 force
(force)
I’d rather be doing time in Leavenworth
Than be Knocking on Heavens Door
Guns N' Roses on the mic
Start to glow and become explosive on the mic
Every rhyme you write got a ferocious overbite
Pull your teeth

It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up
(Goin' down) ugh
It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up
(Goin' down) ugh
When It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, It's up
Ugh
What's up, nigga?
It's up, nigga!

Ridin’ ‘round with a barrel long enough to
Hit a nigga in another city
Enemies are creeping
Tryna come and get me
But they coming with me when I dump a semi
In a Hellcat, that’s another Hemi
I’ma down a nigga like a cup of Henny
If he fucking with me
If he touch a penny of my money
Let a bullet run up in him
Boy, you ain’t fly as me
Flyer than a flying guillotine in the Ming Dynasty
Big watch on the sleeve blinding him
Keep eyeing me
Complete irony
I don’t rap, I just speak violently
As I read from a street diary
Long Beach is on each side of me
Beach pride, it’s the east side in me
(Eastside!)
My murder weapon is a microphone
Niggas probably thought I had a rifle on
On the block spinnin’ get my Michael on
I’m in Babylon witta Bible on
In The New Westament I belong
Every time I write a rap
I got a nigga running back with his Nike‘s on
I Bettis like Jerome when I write a song
Right?

It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up
(Goin' down) ugh
It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up
(Goin' down) ugh
When It's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, It's up
Ugh
What's up, nigga?
It's up, nigga!
