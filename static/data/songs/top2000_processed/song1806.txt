Chemical - Post Malone

Oxytocin makin' it all okay
When I come back down, it doesn't feel the same
Now, I'm sittin' 'round waitin' for the world to end all day
'Cause I couldn't leave you if I tried

You break me, then I break my rules
Last time was the last time too
It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still

Outside of the party, smokin' in the car with you
Seven-nation army fightin' at the bar with you
Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
'Cause I can't let go, it's chemical
No, I can't let go, it's chemical

Every time I'm ready to make a change (Mhm)
You turn around and fuck out all my brains (Woo)
I ain't tryna fight fate, it's too late to save face
I can't get away, maybe there's no mistakes (Maybe there's no mistakes)

You break me, then I break my rules
Last time was the last time too

Outside of the party, smokin' in the car with you
Seven-nation army fightin' at the bar with you
Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
'Cause I can't let go, it's chemical (Chemical)
No, I can't let go, it's chemical (Chemical)
No, I can't let go, it's chemical

I can't let go, it's chemical
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
No, I can't let go, it's chemical
