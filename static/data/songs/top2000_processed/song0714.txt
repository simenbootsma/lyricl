Wonderfull Days - Charly Lownoise & Mental Theo
I found a love but it didn't last
Wonderfull days belong to the past
I don't know where I stand what I'm to do
Try to forget and to find someone new
So I prayed on my knees to heaven above
Send me somebody please someone to love
Now to get to my story give me your hand
Dont let me down cause im hard to demand
