Hold Me - Anouk & Douwe Bob
The things you say
In your innocent way
Remind me how it should be
Your love I can trace
In a wide open space
Oh, your beautiful face I've seen
It's the way you walk
And the way that you talk to me
You're God's gift to my world
The prettiest girl
And I feel like I live a dream
The silence I fear
Preach to the morning sun
So just hold me now
I'll stay here all night, cause I
Don't feel so alone when you are
Holding me tight, love
The things you do and say
Always go hand in hand
You're all you seem to be
Not a shred of you pretends
And I will run like a fool
Just to be by your side
Don't hold back, my love
You're my joy in this sad, sad world
You are safe with me
Dream and you will be freeSo just hold me now
I'll stay here all night, cause I
Don't feel so alone when you are
Holding me tight, love
Just hold me now
I'll stay here all night, cause I
Don't feel so alone when you are
Holding me tight, love (Holding me tight, love)
And if could have it my way
I'd tell you to stay here always
And I will be waiting for you
I'll be waiting and there's nothing else I can do
You've taken me over
Just hold me now
I'll stay here all night, cause I
Don't feel so alone when you are
Holding me tight, love
Holding me tight, love
Holding me tight, love
