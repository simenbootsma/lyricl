I Want It All - Queen

Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming
With no time for doubt
With the pain and anger, can't see a way out

"It ain't much I'm asking", I heard him say
"Got to find me a future, move out of my way"

I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

Listen all you people, come gather 'round
I gotta get me a game plan
Gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People, do you hear me?
Just give me the sign

It ain't much I'm askin'
If you want the truth
Here's to the future

I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
(Give it all, I want it all)
I want it all, and I want it now (Hey)
I want it all, I want it all
(Yes, I want it all! Hey!)
I want it all, and I want it now!


I'm a man with a one-track mind, so much to do in one lifetime
(People, do you hear me?)
Not a man for compromise
And where's and why's and livin' lies
So I'm living it all (Yes, I'm living it all)
And I'm givin' it all
(And I'm givin' it all, ooh, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I want it all!)


It ain't much I'm asking
If you want the truth
Here's to the future
Hear the cry of youth

I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
(Hey, yeah, yeah)
I want it all, and I want it now
(Ooh, ooh) I want it now

I want it, I want it!
Oooh, huh!
