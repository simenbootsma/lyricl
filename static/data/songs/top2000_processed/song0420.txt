Window Of My Eyes - Cuby & the Blizzards
Through the window of my eyes
I can see the rainy day
Sittin' in the chair of my cool room
Looking for a way to be the one who I am
It's useless to cry for the things I once have known
Thinking it will come back and reach my home
It's like a distant face
It's like a shadow on my wall
Something that I can't touch
A heavenly past that calls
Shelter of my mind hides my love and my tear
I keep on looking for a reason which is not here
Through the window of my eyes
I can see a rainy day
Sittin' in the chair of my cool room
Looking for a way to be the one who I am
It's useless to cry for the things I once have known
Thinking it will come back and reach my home
