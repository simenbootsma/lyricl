Desert Rose - Sting & Cheb Mami


Layli, layli, oh
Hathe mada tawila
Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti
Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti
Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti

I dream of rain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of fire
, ya leil, ya leil
Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames, ya leil, ya leil
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
This desert rose, ya leil, ya leil
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower, ya leil, ya leil
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And as she turns, ya leil, ya leil
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns, ya leil, ya leil

I dream of rain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of rain, ya leil, ya leil
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, ya leil, ya leil
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love

Aman, aman, aman
Omry feek antia
Ma ghair antia
Ma ghair antia

I dream of rain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

Sweet desert rose
, ya leil, ya leil
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower, ya leil, ya leil
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
Sweet desert rose
This memory of Eden haunts us all
This desert flower, ya leil, ya leil

Layli, oh-oh, layli, layli, ah-ah-ah
