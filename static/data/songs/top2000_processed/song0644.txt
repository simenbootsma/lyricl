It's A Beautiful Day - Queen

It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining, I feel good
And no one's gonna
Stop me now, oh yeah

It's a beautiful day
I feel good, I feel right
And no one, no one's
Gonna stop me now, mama

Sometimes I feel so sad
So sad, so bad
But no one's gonna
Stop me now, no one
Ooh, it's hopeless
So hopeless to even try
