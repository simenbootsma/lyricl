Hold Me - The Teskey Brothers
Hold me
Don’t hold me down
Carry me
But keep my feet on the ground
That storm is coming down hard
I’m your shelter every time it starts
But if you leave me, I’ll be moving on
You’ll have a hard time drying
When the fire is gone
I’ll hold ya
I won’t hold ya down
I’ll carry ya
But keep your feet on the ground
You’re the storm and I’m the Murray darling
You keep me going
Every time I’m dry
But if you leave me
I’ll be moving on
But have a hard time running
When the weather is gone
Hold me, don’t hold me down
Carry me, but keep my feet on the ground
I’ll hold ya, I won’t hold ya down
I’ll carry ya, but keep your feet on the groundIn so many ways
I just keep pulling
But you’re pushing me away
Me away
Hold me, don’t hold me down
Carry me, but keep my feet on the ground
I’ll hold ya, I won’t hold ya down
Carry ya, but keep your feet on the ground
Hold me, don’t hold me down
Love me, but don’t let me drown
