Heading Up High - Armin van Buuren ft. Kensington

See, when you're holding on to all that you can't, be
Know that all there is to gain lies within arm's, reach
For the flaw lies in your head not in your heart
See, how the darkest night will soon bring light again

Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again
Now it's a long way down
Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again
Now it's a long way down
Now it's a long way down

See, when you're holding on to all but you can't, breathe
Know the dawn lies in your hands just let your heart, speak
And the darkest light will soon burn bright again

Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again
Now it's a long way down
Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again
Now it's a long way down

We won't go in, we won't go
Why end it, why end it
We won't go in, we won't go
Why end it, why end it

Now we're heading up high
Where no harm will get in our way
Will we ever touch ground again
Now it's a long way down
Now it's a long way down

We won't go in, we won't go
Why end it, why end it
We won't go in, we won't go
Why end it, why end it
