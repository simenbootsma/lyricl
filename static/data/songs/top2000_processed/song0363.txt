Welcome To The Jungle - Guns N' Roses

Oh my God
Ooh-ooh
Cha

Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
Mwah, I, I wanna watch you bleed

Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it, you're gonna bleed, but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl, who's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine

*Moaning*

Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here everyday
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
Mwah, I'm gonna watch you bleed

And when you're high, you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down
Yeah, now



You know where you are?
You're in the jungle, baby

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, oh my, my, my serpentine
Jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees

Down in the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Watch it bring you to your
It's going to bring you down
Huh
