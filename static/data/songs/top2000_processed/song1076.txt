Now And Then - The Beatles

(One, two, three)


I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if I make it through
It's all because of you

And now and then
If we must start again
Well, we will know for sure
That I will love you

Now and then
I miss you
Oh, now and then
I want you to be there for me
Always to return to me

I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if you go away

Now and then
I miss you
Oh, now and then
I want you to be there for me

(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ooh)
(Ah)

I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if I make it through
It's all because of you


(Good one)
