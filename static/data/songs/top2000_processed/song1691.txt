Golden Years - David Bowie

Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah

Don't let me hear you say life's
Taking you nowhere, angel
Come, b-b-b-baby
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
Come, b-b-b-baby

There's my baby, lost, that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, wah-wah-wah
Come, b-b-b-baby

Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
Come, b-b-b-baby
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine

I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Come, b-b-b-baby

Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry, my sweet, don't break my heart (Come, b-b-b-baby)
Doing all right, but we gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day
I believe, oh, Lord, I'll believe all the way (Come, b-b-b-baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Come, b-b-b-baby

Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come, b-b-b-baby
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows

I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah (Golden years)
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah (Golden years)
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
Golden years, gold, wah-wah-wah
