You've Got The Love - Florence + The Machine

Sometimes, I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes, I feel like saying, "Lord, I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me through
Sometimes, it seems the goin' is just too rough
And things go wrong, no matter what I do
Now and then, it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through
When food is gone, you are my daily need, oh
When friends are gone, I know my savior's love is real
You know it's real

You've got the love, you've got the love, you've got the love
'Cause you've got the love, you've got the love, you've got the love

Time after time, I think, "Oh, Lord, what's the use?"
Time after time, I think it's just no good
Sooner or later in life, the things you love, you lose
But you've got the love I need to see me through

You've got the love, you've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love, you've got the love
You've got the love, you've got the love, you've got the love

Sometimes, I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
'Cause I know I can count on you, oh
Sometimes, I feel like saying, "Lord, I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me through
