Landslide - Fleetwood Mac

I took my love, took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'Til the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too



Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too

Oh-oh, take my love, take it down
Oh-oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide bring it down

And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring it down
Oh-ohh, the landslide bring it down
