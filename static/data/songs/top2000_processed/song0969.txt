Texas Sun - Khruangbin & Leon Bridges

You say you like the wind blowin' through your hair
Well, come on roll with me 'til the sun goes down

Texas sun

Say you wanna hit the highway while the engine roars
Well, come on, roll with me 'til the sun goes down

That Texas sun, oh yeah
Texas sun

Caressing you from Fort Worth to Amarillo
Well, come on, roll with me 'til the sun dips low

Texas sun
Texas sun, oh girl
That Texas sun

When I'm far from home and them cold winds blow
Stuck out somewhere with folks I don't know
'Cause you keep me nice and you keep me warm

Texas sun
Texas sun
Texas sun (Woah)
Texas sun

You say you like the wind blowing through your hair
Well, come on, roll with me 'til the sun goes down

Texas sun
Texas sun

Ooh baby, you're so gorgeous
How 'bout you and me... take a little trip
In the big body
?

Take a ride with me, baby, you by my side
How does it sound, you and I?
Oh girl
Take a ride with me, baby, you by my side
How does it sound, you and I?
Baby, oh
Take a ride with me, baby, you by my side
How does it sound, you and I?
