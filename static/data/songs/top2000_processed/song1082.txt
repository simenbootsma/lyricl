Hallelujah - Lisa Lois
I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the "Hallelujah"
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Well, maybe there's a god above
But all I've ever learned from love
Is how to shoot somebody who outdrew yaAnd it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah!
(Hallelujah) Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
(Hallelujah)
