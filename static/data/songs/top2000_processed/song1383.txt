Do I Ever - Kensington

Can't sit around holding up my guard
Let it all go, let it all...
(Go around, going in and face the inevitable)
Can't figure out how to play my part
Where do I go? How do I...
(Go around, go in and make it inhabitable)

Now let it all in
(Cover up the arm that holds the weight)
Raging on too long and all will stay
Unsolved

I let it throw me off my feet
I let it put me on my knees
What do I know?
I ought to grow but do I ever?

Can't sit around hiding all my scars
Let them all show, let them all...
(Know about, go in and embrace the inevitable)

Now let it all in
(Cover up the arm that holds your way)
Raging on too long and all will stay

I let it throw me off my feet
I let it put me on my knees
What do I know?
I ought to grow but do I ever?
I let it throw me off my feet
I let it put me on my knees
What do I know?
I ought to grow but do I ever?
I let it...

Take away all I could be
Take all the best of me
Away with it
I'll let it take away all I could see
Take all the best of me
Away with it

I let it throw me off my feet
I let it put me on my knees
What do I know?
I ought to grow but do I ever?
I let it tell me who to be
I let it show me what to see
What do I know?
I ought to grow but do I ever?
I let it throw me off my feet
I let it put me on my knees
What do I know?
I ought to grow but do I ever?
I let it tell me who to be
I let it show me what to see
What do I know?
I ought to grow but do I ever?
Do I ever?
