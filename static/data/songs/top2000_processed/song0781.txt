Friday I'm In Love - The Cure

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday, you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack
Thursday, never looking back
It's Friday, I'm in love


Monday, you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed
Or Thursday, watch the walls instead

Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throw out your frown and just smile at the sound
As sleek as a shriek, spinning round and round
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
It's Friday, I'm in love

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday, you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love, woah

Oh, do-do, do-do, do-do, do
Do-do, do-do, do-do, do
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, yeah
