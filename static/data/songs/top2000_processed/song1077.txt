Hunger Strike - Temple Of The Dog

Well I don't mind stealin' bread from the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled
Yeah

But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies while the slaves are all workin'
And blood is on the table and the mouths are chokin'

But I'm goin' hungry, yeah

I don't mind stealin' bread from the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled, uh-uh, uh

But it's on the table, the fire's cookin'
And they're farmin' babies while the slaves are all workin'
And it's on the table, their mouths are chokin'

But I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry!)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry!)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry!)


I'm goin' hungry (I'm goin' hungry!)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry!)

Yeah, I don't mind stealin' bread! (Ooh, I don't mind)
No, I don't mind stealin' bread
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry!)
I'm goin' hungry (Goin' hungry, yeah!)
