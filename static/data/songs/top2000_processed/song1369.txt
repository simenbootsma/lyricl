90s Kid - DI-RECT

Everyone could do it
There was nothing to it
And you only had to listen to yourself
Skipping class and be moody
Stitching patches on blue jeans
In a land of teenage dreams and cheap motels
Superhero suicide
Streets ablaze with candlelight
A getaway is all I ever wanted

Thinking of what I did
When I was a nineties kid
Feels like a lifetime

Working on a miracle
Better not be cynical
So go live it up now, this is the right time
Rise above the physical
Cranking up a stereo, baby
If we could just g–µt high on life again
Thinking of what I did

Panic rules the world
For all you boys and girls
Save the lost ones crying for attention
Desolate identities
Fifteen second memories
How much for some genuine affection?

'Cause I'm a nineties kid
Something I won't forget
But feels like a lifetime

Working on a miracle
Better not be cynical
So go live it up now, this is the right time
Rise above the physical
Cranking up a stereo, baby
If we could just get high on life again
Thinking of what I did
When I was a nineties kid
Feels like a lifetime

Every one could do it
There was nothing to it

Go live it up now
This is the right time (Woo)
I'm thinking of what I did
When I was a nineties kid
Feels like a lifetime (Woo)
Thinking of what I did
When I was a nineties kid
