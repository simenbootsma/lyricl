Everybody's Changing - Keane

You say you wander your own land
But when I think about it, I don't see how you can
You're aching, you're breaking, and I can see the pain in your eyes
Says, "Everybody's changing and I don't know why"

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Tryin' to make a move just to stay in the game, I'm
Tryin' to stay awake and remember my name, but
Everybody's changing and I don't feel the same

You're gone from here; soon you'll disappear, fading into beautiful light
'Cause everybody's changing and I don't feel right

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Tryin' to make a move just to stay in the game, I'm
Tryin' to stay awake and remember my name, but
Everybody's changing and I don't feel the same

So little time
Try to understand that I'm
Tryin' to make a move just to stay in the game, I'm
Tryin' to stay awake and remember my name, but
Everybody's changing and I don't feel the same
Oh, everybody's changing and I don't feel the same
