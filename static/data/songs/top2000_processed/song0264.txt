Make It A Memory - Krezip & Danny Vera

Hey, how are you?
Did you see the news today?
It's been getting crazy
But it's always been that way
Are you holding up?
And do you turn off your TV
When it makes you worry
Before you fall asleep?

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Just see what tomorrow brings
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Make it a memory
Make it a memory

I know it's quiet
And the days are dragging on
Do you go outside?
Life is lighter in the sun
And just live it up
Buy yourself a new guitar
A couple melodies

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Just see what tomorrow brings
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Make it a memory
Make it a memory

Make it brighter than it's ever been before
Make it brighter than it's ever been before
Brighter than it's ever been before
Make it brighter than it's ever been
Make it brighter than it's ever been before

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Just see what tomorrow brings
Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Make it a memory
Make it a memory
Make it a memory
