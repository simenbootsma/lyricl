They Don't Care About Us - Michael Jackson

"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"
("Don't worry what people say, we know the truth")
"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"
("Enough is enough of this garbage!")
("Okay, alright, alright, alright")
"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"
*overlapping voices*

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang, bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
*** me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, **** me,

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

And tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am a victim of police brutality now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me off my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to Heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black man, blackmail,
throw the brother in jail

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that

And tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame (Ooh)
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name (Ooh)
I can't believe this is the land from which I came (Ooh)

You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that


Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be
No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation (Hoo-hoo)
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food (Hoo-hoo)
Kick me, **** me, don't you wrong or right me (We're deep in fire)

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
We're deep in the fire (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
I'm here to remind you (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us (Hee)
Don't you sit back and watch the beatin'

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about—, hoo-hoo
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about—, hoo-hoo
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us, hee-hee-hee
Hee-hee, hoo-hoo
