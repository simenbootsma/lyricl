Love Myself - Rondé

(I don't need nobody else)

Whatever, I couldn't keep it together
Didn't know what I could be
Never thought that life could get much better
Thought I'd be here forever
Everything was breaking me
My life turned into therapy

Took a little while to see that I was lost, so lost
Now I found myself, I'm never gonna stop

I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody else
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to lovе myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody elsе

So lately I've been keeping my head up
No one's gonna get me down
'Cause I just turned my life around
Go crazy, I don't need your love
So save it, 'cause I have enough

I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody else
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody else

Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa

Took a little while to see that I was lost, so lost
Now I found myself, I'm never gonna stop

I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody else
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to love myself
I'm ready to go
No, I don't, I don't need nobody

Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa (I don't need nobody)
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-da-da-pa
