Ziggy Stardust - David Bowie

Oh
Oh yeah

Now Ziggy played guitar
, jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders From Mars
He played it left hand
, but made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man, well-hung and snow-white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass, he was the nazz
With God-given ass
, he took it all too far

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Oh yeah
Ooh

Ziggy played guitar
