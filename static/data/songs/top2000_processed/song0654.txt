One Way Wind - The Cats

You said some winds blow forever
And I didn't understand
But you saw my eyes were asking
And smiling you took my hand

So we walked along the seaside
Where trees grow just one way
Pointing out the one direction
That the wind blows day after day

One way wind
One way wind
Are you tryin' to blow my mind?
One way wind
One way wind
Is she her that I hoped to find?

Why you blow the cold ev'ry day?
Tell me, what are you tryin' to say?

No, I don't know all about you
And maybe I never will
But I do know ev'ry word of

And whenever I will see you
For maybe one more time
I'm sure I'll get the answer
That the wind has still in mind

One way wind
One way wind
Are you tryin' to blow my mind?
One way wind
One way wind
Is she her that I hoped to find?

Why you blow the cold ev'ry day?
Tell me, what are you tryin' to say?

One way wind
One way wind
Are you tryin' to blow my mind?
One way wind
One way wind
Is she her that I hoped to find?
One way wind
One way wind
Are you tryin' to blow my mind?
One way wind
One way wind
