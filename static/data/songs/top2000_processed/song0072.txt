The Scientist  - Coldplay

Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
And tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
No, let's go back to the start
Runnin' in circles, comin' up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessin' at numbers and figures
Pullin' your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
And tell me you love me,
come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Runnin' in circles, chasin' our tails

Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm goin' back to the start


Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
