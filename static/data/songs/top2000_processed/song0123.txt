Gimme Shelter - The Rolling Stones

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh, a storm is threatening
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
, yeah

Ooh, see the fire is sweepin'
Our very streets today
Burns like a red-coal carpet

War, children
, yeah
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children
, yeah
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away


Rape, murder, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Rape, murder, yeah, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
Yeah

Mmm, a flood is threatening
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm going to fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

I tell you, love, sister
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Kiss away, kiss away
