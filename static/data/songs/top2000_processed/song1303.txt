Enemy - Imagine Dragons

Look out for yourself

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us (Ha)

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look; yeah)
(Look out for yourself)


Uh, look, okay
I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up

Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Oh, the misery (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy (Ah)
Everybody wants to be my enemy

Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint
(Look out for yourself)
