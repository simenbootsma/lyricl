Pride And Joy - Stevie Ray Vaughan

Well, you've heard about lovin' givin' sight to the blind
My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine

She my sweet little thing
She my pride and joy
She my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

Yeah, I love my baby
My heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old

She my sweet little thing
She my pride and joy
She my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

Yeah, I love my lady
She's long and lean
You mess with her

She my sweet little thing
She my pride and joy
She my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy


Well, I love my baby
Like the finest wine
Stick with her until the end of time

She my sweet little thing
She my pride and joy
She my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

Yeah, I love my baby
My heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old

She my sweet little thing
She my pride and joy
She my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy
