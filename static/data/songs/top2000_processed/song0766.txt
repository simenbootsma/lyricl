Breakthru - Queen

When love breaks up, (Breaks up)
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born
Somehow I have to make
This final breakthrough, now!

I wake up, feel just fine
Your face fills my mind
I get religion quick
Because you're looking divine
Honey, you're touching something
You're touching me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell
Can't you see?

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
Oh, yeah

(Break through) These barriers of pain
(Break through) Yeah, into the sunshine, from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out
For you now
Somehow I have to make this
Final (break)through

Your smile speaks books
to me
I break up with each and every one of your looks at me
Honey, you're starting something
Deep inside of me
Honey, you're sparking something
This fire in me
I'm outta control, I want to rush
Headlong into this ecstasy

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough!
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
Oh, yeah

(Breakthrough)
(Breakthrough)
(Breakâ€”)

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough

Breakthrough!
