Long As I Can See The Light - Creedence Clearwater Revival

Put a candle in the window
But I feel I've got to move
Though I'm going, going
, I'll be coming home soon
Long as I can see the light

Pack my bag and let's get movin'
'Cause I'm bound to drift a while
While I'm gone, gone, you don't have to worry no
Long as I see the light


Guess I've got that old travelin' bone
'Cause that feelin' won't leave me alone
But I won't, won't be losin' my way, no, no
Long as I can see the light
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah

Put a candle in the window
But I feel I've got to move
Though I'm going, going, I'll be coming home soon

Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
Long as I can see the light
