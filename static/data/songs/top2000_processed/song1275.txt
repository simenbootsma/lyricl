Cambodia - Kim Wilde

Well, he was Thailand-based, she was an air force wife
He used to fly weekends, it was the easy life
But then it turned around and he began to change
She didn't wonder then, she didn't think it's strange

But then he got a call, he had to leave that night
He couldn't say too much, but it would be alright
He didn't need to pack, they'd meet the next night
He had a job to do
Flying to Cambodia


And as the nights passed by, she tried to trace the past
The way he used to look, the way he used to laugh
I guess she'll never know what got inside his soul
She couldn't make it out, just couldn't take it all

He had the saddest eyes the girl had ever seen
He used to cry some nights as though he lived a dream
And as she held him close, he used to search her face
As though she knew the truth


But then a call came through, they said he'd soon be home
She had to pack a case and they would make a rendezvous
But now a year has passed and not a single word
And all the love she knew has disappeared out in the haze

Cambodia
Don't cry now
No tears now


And now the years have passed with not a single word
But there is only one thing left I know for sure
She won't see his face again
