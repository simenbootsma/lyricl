Mr. Blue Sky - Electric Light Orchestra

Morning! Today's forecast calls for blue skies

Sun is shinin' in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin'
Everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day
Hey-ey-hey

Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city
On the streets where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today
Hey-ey-hey

Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long? (So long)
Where did we go wrong?
Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)


Hey, you, with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration
Mr. Blue Sky's up there waitin'
And today
Is the day we've waited for
Ah-ah-ah

Oh, Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long? (So long)
Where did we go wrong?

Hey there, Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you
Hey there, Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do

Mr. Blue Sky
Mr. Blue Sky
Mr. Blue Sky-y

Mr. Blue, you did it right
But soon comes Mr. Night
Creepin' over, now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind, I'll remember you this
I'll remember you this way

Mr. Blue Sky
Please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long? (So long)
Where did we go wrong?

Hey there, Mr. Blue (Sky)
We're so pleased to be with you (Sky)
Look around, see what you do (Blue)
Everybody smiles at you
