Just Say Yes  - Snow Patrol

I'm running out of ways to make you see
I want you to stay here beside me
I won't be okay and I won't pretend I am
So, just tell me today and take my hand
Please take my hand, please take my hand
Please take my hand, please take my hand

Just say yes
Just say there's nothing holding you back
It's not a test, nor a trick of the mind
Only love

It's so simple and you know it is
You know it is
We can't be to and fro like this all our lives
You're the only way to me
The path is clear
What do I have to say to you?
For God's sake, dear
For God's sake, dear
For God's sake, dear
For God's sake, dear

Just say yes
Just say there's nothing holding you back
It's not a test, nor a trick of the mind
Only love

I can feel your heart beat through my shirt
This was all I wanted, all I want
It's all I want
It's all I want
It's all I want
It's all I want

Just say yes
Just say there's nothing holding you back
It's not a test, nor a trick of the mind
Only love

Just say yes
'Cause I'm aching, I know you are too
For the touch of your warm skin
As I breathe you in
