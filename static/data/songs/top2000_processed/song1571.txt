The Boys Are Back In Town - Thin Lizzy

Guess who just got back today?
Them wild-eyed boys that'd been away
Haven't changed, hadn't much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy

The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
(I said) The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town

You know that chick that used to dance a lot?
Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place

The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
(I said) The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town


Spread the word around
Guess who's back in town
You spread the word around

Friday night, they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
And if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner blastin' out my favourite song
The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long
Won't be long till summer comes

The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
(Spread the word around)
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
(The boys are back, the boys are back)


The boys are back in town again
Been hangin' down at Dino's
The boys are back in town again
