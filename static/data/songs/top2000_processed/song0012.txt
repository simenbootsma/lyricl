Wish You Were Here - Pink Floyd

"And disciplinary remains mercifully"
"Yes and um, Iâ€™m with you, Derek, this star nonsense"
"Yes, yes"
"Now which is it?"
"I am sure of it"


So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell?
Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?


How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
