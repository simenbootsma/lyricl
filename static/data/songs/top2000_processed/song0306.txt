I Would Stay - Krezip

If this is true, I thought then, what will I think
Will I stay or rather I would get away
I'm scared that I won't find a thing
And afraid that I'll turn out to be alone

But I
I have to learn, have to try
Have to trust I have to cry
Have to see, have to know
That I can be myself

And if I could, I would stay
And if they're not, not in my way
I'll stare here in the distance
But I'll grow up to be just like you
Yeah, I'll grow up to be just like you
Yeah

I see it all I'm sure but do I know what's right
Thought I knew, but it turns out the other way
I am scared that I won't find a thing

But I
I have to learn, have to try
Have to trust I have to cry
Have to see, have to know
That I can be myself

And if I could I would stay
And if they're not, not in my way
I'll stare here in the distance
But I'll grow up to be just like you
Yeah, I'll grow up to be just like you

I wanna tell you
Why (Would I try to)
Would I try to
You (Are all that)
All I can see now
Why would I try to
And I want to tell you
Why would I try to
You are all I can see now

I have to learn, have to try
I have to trust I had to cry
Have to see, have to know
That I can be myself

And if I could, yeah, I would stay
And if they're not, not in my way
I'll stare here in the distance
But I'll grow up to be just like you
Yeah, I'll grow up to be just like you

Like you
