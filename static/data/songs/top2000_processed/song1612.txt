Born To Be Alive - Patrick Hernandez

We were born to be—
Alive!
We were born to be—
Alive!
Born, born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes, we were
Born, born, born
(Born to be alive)

People asked me why I never
Find a place to stop and settle
Down, down, down
But I never wanted all those things
People need to justify their
Lives, lives, lives

Yes, we were born
Born, born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes, we were
Born, born, born
(Born to be alive)
It's good to be alive
To be alive
To be alive
It's good to be alive
To be alive
To be alive

Time was on my side when I was
Running down the street, it was no
Bind, bind, bind
A suitcase and an old guitar and
Something new to occupy my
Mind, mind, mind

Yes, we were born
Born, born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes, we were
Born, born, born
(Born to be alive)
Yes, we were born
Born, born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes, we were
Born, born, born
(Born to be alive)
Yes, we were born
Born, born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes, we were
Born, born, born
(Born to be alive)
Born, born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes, we were
Born, born, born
(Born to be alive)
Born, born to be alive
