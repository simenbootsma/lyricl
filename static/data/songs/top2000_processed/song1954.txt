 So Strong - Labi Siffre
The higher you build your barriers
The taller I become
The further you take my rights away
The faster I will run
You can deny me
You can decide to turn your face away
No matter, 'cause there's....
Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, Oh no
Something inside so strong, Oh - oh oh oh oh oh
Something inside so strong!
The more you refuse to hear my voice
The louder I will sing
You hide behind walls of Jericho
Your lies will come tumbling
Deny my place in time
You squander wealth that's mine
My light will shine so brightly
It will blind you
Because there's......
Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, Oh no
Something inside so strong, Oh - oh oh oh oh oh
Something inside so strong!Brothers and sisters!
When they insist we're just not good enough
When we know better
Just look 'em in the eye and say
We're gonna do it anyway
We're gonna do it anyway
Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, Oh no
Something inside so strong, Oh - oh oh oh oh oh
Something inside so strong!
Brothers and sisters!
When they insist we're just not enough
When we know better
Just look 'em in the eye and say
We're gonna do it anyway
We're gonna do it anyway
We're gonna do it anyway
We're gonna do it anyway
Because there's
Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, Oh no
Something inside so strong!
Something inside so strong
I know that I can make it
Though you're doing me wrong, so wrong
You thought that my pride was gone, Oh no
Something inside so strong, Oh - oh oh oh oh oh
Something inside so strong, Oh - oh oh oh oh oh
Something inside so strong, Oh - oh oh oh oh oh
Something insi – de... so... stro – ng!
