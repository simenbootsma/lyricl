I Put A Spell On You - Creedence Clearwater Revival

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop
The things that you're doing
I said "watch out!"
I ain't lying, yeah!
I ain't gonna take none of your
Fooling around
I ain't gonna take none of your
Putting me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
All right!

I put a spell on you

Fooling around
I ain't gonna take none of your
Putting me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mineAll right and I took it down!
