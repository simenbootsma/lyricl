Promises Of No Man's Land - Blaudzun
Save
Save grace for a leap day
No room for tears
Outside this door
Go, please daddy I'll show
My Friday night bruises
And I will fight this war
Our home feels like a foreign land
A land not safe from torment
The promises of no man's land
...will fail the sons and daughters
Who fear to cross the borders
The promises of no man's land
When the heat is on
The heat is on
And the heat is on
It's your pride don't waste it up
Burn
Go and watch me burn
Through the fire
I will returnOur home feels like a foreign land
A land not safe from torment
The promises of no man's land
...will fail the sons and daughters
Who fear to cross the borders
The promises of no man's land
When the heat is on
If the heat is on
And the heat is on
It's your pride don't waste it up
When the heat is on
The heat is on
And the heat is on
It's your pride don't waste it up
When the heat is on
The heat is on
And the heat is on
It's your pride don't waste it up
