Amigo - Chef'Special

You don’t know me I don’t know who you are
But I know that you live with me under these stars
Oh, I don’t know you you don’t know who we are
But I’m on your team you can throw me the ball
You move in ways and play rules I don’t know
Oh they’re strange that’s okay I’ma fast learner so let’s go

Amígo! Let’s go!
Amígo! Let’s go!

I’m gonna follow if you take the lead
Strangers are strangers until they meet
I’m gonna follow if you take the lead
Strangers are strangers until they meet

You got your dance got your move got your drum
It ain’t nothing like mine son but it do sound like fun
What’s that song you got in your headphone can I listen me some
I know you think I'ma little different but I’m still somebody’s son
Where u going what you drinking, can I have me one

Amígo! Let’s go!
Amígo! Let’s go!

I’m gonna follow if you take the lead
Strangers are strangers until they meet
I’m gonna follow if you take the lead
Strangers are strangers until they meet

Now come wake me, now come wake me up
Now come wake me, now come wake me up
Now come wake me, I know it’s out there, now come wake me up, slowly getting louder
Now come wake me, middle of nowhere
Oh let’s go there

Amígo! Let’s go!
Amígo! Let’s go!

I’m gonna follow if you take the lead
Strangers are strangers until they meet
I’m gonna follow if you take the lead
Strangers are strangers until they meet
I’m gonna follow if you take the lead
Strangers are strangers until they meet
