People Are Strange - The Doors

People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

When you're strange, faces come out of the rain
When you're strange, no one remembers your name
When you're strange, when you're strange
When you're strange

People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down


When you're strange, faces come out of the rain
When you're strange, no one remembers your name
When you're strange, when you're strange
When you're strange


When you're strange, faces come out of the rain
When you're strange, no one remembers your name
When you're strange, when you're strange
When you're strange
