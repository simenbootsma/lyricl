Soldier On - DI-RECT

Soldiering on woman, you're always true to form
Just keep on pushing your shopping cart through the storm
Most people buy it, but you feel it's one that we can no longer afford
You stopped believing in our story, you say it's way too short

Ain't nobody out there as brave as you, you're holdin' your own
A million different voices that are trying to break you
Just listen to one
The one that's inside you, and soldier on

You're governed by the winds that reign
You armed yourself with a flower chain and a broken cane
Nobody cares how you feel like they think your heart doesn't bleed the same
We wouldn't hear the truth if it cried in our faces

Ain't nobody out there as brave as you, you're holdin' your own (Oh, Oh)
A million different voices that are trying to break you
Just listen to one
The one that's inside you, and soldier on (Oh, Oh, soldier on)
And soldier on
And soldier on
