Give Up Your Guns - The Buoys

When I woke up this morning
I found myself alone
I turned to touch her hair but she was gone
She was gone

And there beside my pillow
Were her tears from the night before
She said: "Give up your guns and face the law"

I robbed a bank in Tampa
And I thought I had it made
But, the hounds picked up my trail within the glades
So, I ran!

And I stumbled on this cabin
And she came to me once more
She said: "Give up your guns and face the law"

I don't wanna leave her!
I don't wanna die!
Deep within a cold, cold grave
With no one 'round to cry
But I've got my pistol
Now, it's time to choose
Shooting here or hanging there

And now I'm in this cabin
Where my own true love should be
Instead there lies a note she wrote to me
And it says:

"No! You can't live by the bullet
But you sure as death can die
My love! Give up your guns or say goodbye, goodbye!"

And the sheriff now is calling
With his shotgun at my door:
"Son! Give up your guns
And face the law"
