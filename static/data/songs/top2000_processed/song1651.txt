Whisky In The Jar  - Thin Lizzy

As I was goin' over
The Cork
and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell
And his money he was countin'

I first produced my pistol
And then produced my rapier
I said "Stand o'er and deliver
Or the devil he may take ya"
.

Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da
Whack for my daddy-o
,
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

I took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money
And I brought it home to Molly

She swore that she'd love me
Never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman

Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da
Whack for my daddy-o
,
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Being drunk and weary
I went to Molly's chamber
Takin' my money with me
And I never knew the danger

For about six or maybe seven
In walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols
And I shot him with both barrels

Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da
Whack for my daddy-o
,
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Now some men like the fishin'
And some men like the fowlin'
,
And some men like ta hear

Me? I like sleepin'
Especially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison
Here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Musha ring dumb a do dumb a da
Whack for my daddy-o
,
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

And I got drunk on whiskey-o
And I loved, I loved, I loved
I loved, I loved, I loved my Molly-o
And cheerio Farrell
And I'll burn it down
That dirty ol' town
