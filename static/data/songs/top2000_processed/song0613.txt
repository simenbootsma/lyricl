Sex On Fire - Kings Of Leon

Lay where you're layin'
Don't make a sound
I know they're watchin'
They're watchin'
All the commotion
The kiddie-like play
It has people talkin'
Talkin'

You
Your sex is on fire

The dark of the alley
The breakin' of day
Head while I'm drivin'
I'm drivin'
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dyin'
You're dyin'

You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed

Hot as a fever
Rattlin' bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
If it's not forever
If it's just tonight
Oh, we're still the greatest
The greatest, the greatest

You
Your sex is on fire
You
Your sex is on fire, ah
Consumed
With what's to transpire
And you
Your sex is on fire
Consume
With what's to transpire
