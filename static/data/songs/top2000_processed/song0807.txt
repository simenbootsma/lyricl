Superstition - Stevie Wonder

Very superstitious
Writing's on the wall
Very superstitious
Ladder's 'bout to fall
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
The good things in your past

When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeah

Ooh, very superstitious
Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong
You don't want to save me

When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeah

Very superstitious
Nothing more to say
Very superstitious
The devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
Good things in your past

When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
No, no, no
