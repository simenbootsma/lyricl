Madness - Muse

Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad

I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness is starting to evolve, mm
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad)
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad)
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad)
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad)

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you mean

Hoo, huh-huh-huh-hoo

Now, I need to know, is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat? Mm
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad)
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad)
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had
It's like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad)

Now, I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realised
What you need

Hoo, huh-huh-huh-huh-hoo


(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad)
(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mad-mad-mad)

Now, I have finally seen the end (Finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care, no (Expecting you to care)
That I have finally seen the light (Finally seen the light)
And I have finally realised (Realised)
I need your love
I need your love

Come to me, just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes, I know, I can be wrong
And baby, you're too headstrong
