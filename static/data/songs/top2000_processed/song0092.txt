Mr. Brightside - The Killers

Comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head,
but she's touching his

Chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibi
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes

(It was only a kiss) It was only a kiss

Chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibi
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me

I never
I never
I never
