Sunrise - Norah Jones

Sunrise, sunrise looks like mornin' in your eyes
But the clock's held 9:15 for hours
Sunrise, sunrise couldn't tempt us if it tried
'Cause the afternoon's already come and gone

And I said, "Hoh, ooh, hoo, ooh
Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh
Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh"
To you

Surprise, surprise, couldn't find it in your eyes
But I'm sure it's written all over my face
Surprise, surprise, never something I could hide
When I see we made it through another day

And I said, "Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh
Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh
Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh"
To you

Now, the night will throw its cover down
Mm, on me again
Ooh, and if I'm right, it's the only way

"Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh
Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh
Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh"
To you
"Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh" (Well, yeah)
"Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh" (Mm-hm, mmm)
"Hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh"
To you
