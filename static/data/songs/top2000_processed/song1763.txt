Night Changes - One Direction

Goin' out tonight, changes into somethin' red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showin' off
Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair
She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants

(Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearin' when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothin' to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you

Chasin' her tonight, doubts are runnin' round her head
He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet

(Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearin' when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothin' to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh

Goin' out tonight, changes into somethin' red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost

(Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearin' when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothin' to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change, baby
(Ooh) It will never change, baby
(Ooh) It will never change me and you
