It's A Long Way To The Top  - AC/DC

Alright

Ridin' down the highway
Goin' to a show
Stoppin' on the byways
Playin' rock 'n' roll

Gettin' robbed, gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up, broken boned
Gettin' had, gettin' took
I tell you folks, it's harder than it looks

It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doin' one-night stands
Try playin' in a rock-roll band
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll


Hotel, motel
Make you want to cry
Ladies do the hard sell
Know the reason why

Gettin' old, gettin' gray
Gettin' ripped off, underpaid
Gettin' sold, second-hand
That's how it goes, playin' in a band

It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out, it's rough and mean
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock 'n' roll

Well, it's a long way
Oh, it's a long way, you should have told me
It's a long way
Such a long way
