Hind's Hall - Macklemore

Woo
Yeah

The people, they won't leave
What is threatenin’ about divesting
and wantin' peace
?
The problem isn't the protests, it’s what they're protesting
It goes against what our country is funding
(Hey) Block the barricade until Palestine is free
(Hey) Block the barricade until Palestine is free
When I was seven, I learned a lesson from Cube and Eazy-E
What was it again? Oh yeah, fuck the police
(Woo)

Actors in badges protecting property
And a system that was designed by white supremacy (Brrt)
But the people are in the streets
You can pay off Meta
, you can't pay off me
Politicians who serve by any means
AIPAC
, CUFI
, and all the companies
You see, we sell fear around
the land of the free
But this generation here is about to cut the strings
You can ban TikTok
, take us out the algorithm
But it's too late, we've seen the truth, we bear witness
Seen the rubble, the buildings, the mothers and the children
And all the men that you murdered,
and then we see how you spin it
Who gets the right to defend and who gets the right of resistance
Has always been about dollars
and the color of your pigment, but
White supremacy is finally on blast

We see the lies in ’em
Claimin’ it's antisemitic to be anti-Zionist
I’ve seen Jewish brothers and sisters out there and ridin' in
Solidarity and screamin' "Free Palestine" with them
Organizin', unlearnin’ and finally cuttin' ties with
A state that's gotta rely on an apartheid system
To uphold an occupyin' violent
History been repeating for the last seventy-five
The Nakba never ended
, the colonizer lied
(Woo)
If students in tents posted on the lawn
Occupyin' the quad is really against the law
And a reason to call in the police and their squad
Where does genocide land in your definition, huh? (Hey; hey)
Destroyin' every college in Gaza and every mosque
Pushin' everyone into Rafah and droppin' bombs
The blood is on your hands, Biden, we can see it all
And fuck no, I'm not votin' for you in the fall (Woo)
Undecided
You can't twist the truth, the people out here united
Never be defeated when freedom's on the horizon
Yet the music industry's quiet, complicit in their platform of silence (Hey, woo)

What happened to the artist? What d'you got to say?
If I was on a label, you could drop me today
I'd be fine with it 'cause the heart fed my page
I want a ceasefire, fuck a response from Drake (Woo)
What you willin' to risk? What you willin' to give?
What if you were in Gaza? What if those were your kids?
If the West was pretendin' that you didn't exist

Brrt
Woo
