Just Breathe - Pearl Jam

Yes, I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Oh, I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah, others, they got none, uh-huh

Stay with me, oh, let's just breathe
(Ooh-ooh)

Practiced are my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh
Under everythin', just another human bein', uh-huh
Yeah, I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed

Stay with me, you're all I see

Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool, you see
No one knows this more than me

As I come clean
I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh

Nothin' you would take, everythin' you gave

Did I say that I need you?
Oh, did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool, you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean, I

(Ah)
(Ah-ah)

Nothin' you would take, everythin' you gave
Oh, hold me 'til I die, meet you on the other side
