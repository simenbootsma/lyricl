Bloodbuzz Ohio - The National

Stand up straight at the foot of your love, I
Lift my shirt up
Stand up straight at the foot of your love, I
Lift my shirt up

I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me

Lay my head on the hood of your car, I
Take it too far
Lay my head on the hood of your car, I
Take it too far

I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
The floors are fallin' down from everybody I know

I'm on a blood buzz, yes I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I'm on a blood buzz, God I am

I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me

I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money to the money I owe
The floors are fallin' down from everybody I know

I'm on a blood buzz, yes I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I'm on a blood buzz, God I am
I'm on a blood buzz
