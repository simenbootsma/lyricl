Roller Coaster - Danny Vera
Songtekst van Danny Vera - "Roller Coaster"

Here we go
On this rollercoaster life we know
With those crazy highs and real deep lows
I really don't know why
And I will go
To the farthest place on earth I know
I can travel all the roads, you see
’Cause I know you're there with me

You don't have to slow me down
’Cause I will always be around
I will find my way back home
Where magnolia grows, where magnolia grows

But I guess you know
Why I do, what I do and where I go
I try to fill an empty space inside
But I can't do that without you
You're even with me in my dreams
I see a sail, the seven seas
I will try to find my way

Here we go
On this rollercoaster life we know
With those crazy heights and real deep lows
I really don't know why
And I will go
To the farthest place on earth I know
I can travel all the roads, you see
'Cause I know you there with me
You don't have to slow me down
’Cause I will always be around
I will find my way back home
Where magnolia grows, where magnolia grows
Here we go
On this rollercoaster life we know
With those crazy highs and real deep lows
I really don’t know why
And I will go
To the farthest place on earth I know
I can travel all the roads, you see
'Cause I know you’re there with me

Here we go
On this rollercoaster life we know
I can travel all the roads, you see
'Cause I know you're there with me
'Cause I know, oh I know
You’re there with me
