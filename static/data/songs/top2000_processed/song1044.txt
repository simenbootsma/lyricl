Close To Me - The Cure

I've waited hours for this, I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me

Just try to see in the dark, just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out, hold my breath and wait until I shake

But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me

But if I had your faith

Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream
