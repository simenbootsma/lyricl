Hells Bells - AC/DC


I'm a rollin' thunder, pourin' rain
I'm comin' on like a hurricane
White lightning's flashin' across the sky
You're only young, but you're gonna die

I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's puttin' up a fight
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
I'm gonna get ya, Satan get ya

Hell's bells
Yeah, hell's bells
You got me ringin' hell's bells
My temperature's high, hell's bells

I'll give you black sensations up and down your spine
If you're into evil, you're a friend of mine
See my white light flashin' as I split the night

I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's puttin' up a fight
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
I'm gonna get ya, Satan get ya

Hell's bells
Oh, hell's bells
You got me ringin' hell's bells
My temperature's high, hell's bells

Yeah

Hell's bells, Satan's comin' to you
Hell's bells, he's ringin' them now
Those hell's bells, the temperature's high
Hell's bells, across the sky
Hell's bells, they're takin' you down
Hell's bells, they're draggin' you under
Hell's bells, gonna split the night
Hell's bells, there's no way to fight, yeah

Ow
Ow, ow
Ow, yes
Hell's bells
