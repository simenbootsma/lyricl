I Will Follow  - U2

Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you: I will follow

I was on the outside
When you say, you say you needed me
I was looking at myself
I was blind, could not see (Yeah)

A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by his hand
He stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh, why?

If you walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
I will follow

I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window

Walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
I will follow

Your eyes make a circle
I see you when I go in there
But it's your eyes
But it's your eyes
But it's your eyes
Hey, your, your eyes

If you walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
I will follow

I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will
I will
I will
I will
