Through The Looking Glass - DI-RECT

It's so quiet in the city
Well, living inside isn't easy
I'll be drinking at my own front door
There's nowhere to feel safe
My home is an arena
What is it that we're fighting for?
No looking past the looking glass
And you will meet at last

So tell me who wants to live forever
When there's nothing to believe in?
Part-time freedom
No one ever said it would be easy
There's no treatment
When you're down, you gotta get up
But don't stop dreaming, dreamеr

Spinning out every minute
Infinity running in circlеs
One wave will flood a hundred shores
The things that we sacrifice
Things that gave us life
And we've been here before
We're fighting a lost war
Burdens from the past
Our eyes will meet at last

So tell me who wants to live forever
When there's nothing to believe in?
Part-time freedom
No one ever said it would be easy
There's no treatment
When you're down, you gotta get up
But don't stop dreaming, dreamer

They're getting closer now
Dreams that bend your way
Getting closer now
Don't stop dreaming now
They're getting closer now

So tell me who wants to live forever
When there's nothing to believe in?
Part-time freedom
No one ever said it would be easy
There's no treatment
When you're down, you gotta get up
And don't stop dreaming, dreamer

(Live forever)
When there's nothing to believe in
(Part-time freedom)
No one ever said it would be easy
(There's no treatment)
When you're down, you gotta get up
But don't stop dreaming, dreamer
