Tonight - Son Mieux

When you're a little out of touch
I'm a little out of sight
We've been walking this road for quite some time
As I stumble into fear
I stand my ground and draw a line
I'm tired of being the one who runs and hides

Know I'll be here by your side
Let it out, can you try
To feel it, feel it?
I'll be here by your side
Let me in and I will try
To feel a little more, a little more than before

And tonight
If you're a little down, then so am I
Side by side
We'll make it to the morning light
It's all right
If you're a little down, then so am I
Side by side, side by side

One step at a time
In the blink of an eye
We'll let the moment live and let the moment die
It could break our hearts
But if falling apart can help us feel
Come on, let it hurt and let it heal

And I'll be here by your side
Let it out, can you try
To feel it, feel it?
I'll be here by your side
Just let me in and I will try
To feel a little more, a little more than before

And tonight
If you're a little down, then so am I
Side by side
We'll make it to the morning light
It's all right
If you're a little down, then so am I
Side by side, side by side

Feel the years, feel the pain
Feel the tears drifting away
Feel the breaking of the chains
Feel the weight, fading away

And know that tonight
If you're a little down, then so am I
Side by side
We'll make it to the morning light
It's all right
If you're a little down, then so am I
Side by side, side by side
We'll make it to the morning light
We'll make it to the morning light

'Cause tonight
If you're a little down, then so am I
Side by side, side by side
We'll make it to the morning light
