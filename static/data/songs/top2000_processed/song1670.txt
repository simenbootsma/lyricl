The Air That I Breathe - The Hollies

If I could make a wish, I think I'd pass
Can't think of anythin' I need

No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound
Nothing to eat, no books to read

Making love with you has left me peaceful, warm, and tired
What more could I ask? There's nothing left to be desired

Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep

Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you all I need is the air that I breathe
Yes, to love you all I need is the air that I breathe


Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak

Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you all I need is the air that I breathe
Yes, to love you all I need is the air that I breathe

Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you all I need is the air that I breathe
Yes, to love you all I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you all I need is the air that I breathe
Yes, to love you
