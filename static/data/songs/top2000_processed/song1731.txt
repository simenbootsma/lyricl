The Devil's Son - Danny Vera

I can be the one you want
I can be your best friend John
We can watch a game together
Or just talk about the weather
I can hang out at your house
Drinking beers on your couch
I will sit there throughout the day
Your fridge is empty by the way
Then I'll amuse your dog for hours
I'll watch your girlfriend while she showers
I will wear your favorite shirt
I will smile when you get hurt
I got issues from the past
Maybe it's the voices in my head

But sometimes I just sit here by myself
And recall the things I've done
My parents treated me so bad
They called me the devil's son

I'll sleep on your side of the bed
I'll wet myself and crumble bread
Check some porn on your TV
Later touch myself, maybe
I can give your girl a call
And say you don't love her at all
Say you're gay and dating Percy
And you like to beg for mercy
Or I will sit next to your bed
With a gun aimed at your head
Yeah, it makes me feel alive
'Cause I do weird shit at night
Now I'm howlin' at the moon

But sometimes I just sit here by myself
And recall the things I've done
You're treating me so bad
You're calling me the devil's son

I could call the cops and say you're stoned
And that you're in the house alone
With a loaded gun and a little girl
We'll be headline news around the world
Maybe someday I'll find myself
Get a shrink and get some help
Blow a bullet through my brain
Lay on the tracks, wait for the train
Tie a rope around my neck
Maybe then the voices won't come back

But sometimes I just sit here by myself
And recall the things I've done
The world has treated me so bad
They called me the devil's son
But sometimes I just sit here by myself
And recall the things I've done
The world has treated me so bad
They called me the devil's son
