I Follow Rivers - Triggerfinger

Oh I beg you, can I follow
Oh I ask you why not always
Be the ocean where unravel
Be my only
Be the water where I'm wading
You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild

I-I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I-I follow, I follow you
Dark doom honey, I follow you

He's a message
I'm the runner
He the rebel
I'm the daughter waiting for you
You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild

I-I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I-I follow, I follow you

You're my river running high
Run deep, run wild

I-I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I-I follow, I follow you
Dark doom honey, I follow you
I-I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I-I follow, I follow you
Dark doom honey, I follow you
