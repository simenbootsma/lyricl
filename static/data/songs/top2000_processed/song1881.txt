Relight My Fire - Dan Hartman
Help me escape this feelin' of insecurity
I need you so much but I don't think you really need me
But if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I've got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night
You took away the love that I knew
Relight my fire
Your love is my only desire
Relight my fire
'Cause I need your love
Turn back the times 'til the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin' I was there with you
But if we all stand up for what we believe
And maybe live within our possibilities
The world would be wild for the dream
So baby don't turn away
Listen to what I gotta say
Relight my fire
Your love is my only desire
Relight my fire
'Cause I need your love
Relight my fire
Your love is my only desire
Relight my fire
'Cause I need your loveYou gotta be strong enough to walk on through the night (yeah)
There's a new day on the other side (yeah)
You got to have hope in your soul
Just keep on walkin', yeah
Just keep on walkin', yeah, walk on
Just keep on, walk on
Strong enough to walk on through the night (through the night)
There's a new day on the other side (the other side, the other side)
I got to have hope in my soul (in your soul)
So I'll keep on walkin', yeah
Keep on walkin'
Relight my fire (gotta keep the fire burnin')
Your love is my only desire
Relight my fire
'Cause I need your love
