Move On Up - Curtis Mayfield

Hush now, child
And don't you cry
Your folks might understand you
By and by

Just move on up
Toward your destination
Though you may find, from time to time
Complication

Bite your lip
And take the trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip

Just move on up
For peace you'll find
Into the steeple of beautiful people
Where there's only one kind

So hush now, child
And don't you cry
Your folks might understand you

Move on up
And keep on wishin'
Remember your dream is your only scheme
So keep on pushin'

Take nothing less
Than the supreme best
Do not obey rumors people say
For you can pass the test

Just move on up
To a greater day
With just a little faith, if you put your mind to it
You can surely do it
Just move on up
Move on up
But move on up
Oh, child, but just a-move on up
But move on up
Move on up
