Trapped  - Bruce Springsteen

Seems like I'm caught up in your trap again
Seems like I'll be wearing the same old chains
Good will conquer evil and the truth will set me free
And I know someday I will find the key
I know somewhere I will find the key
Seems like I've been playing your game way too long
Seems the game I've played has made you strong
When the game is over I won't walk out the loser
I know I'll walk out of here again
I know someday I'll walk out of here again

Well now I'm trapped
Ooh yeah

Seems like I've been sleeping in your bed too long
Seems like you've been meaning to do me harm
But I'll teach my eyes to see beyond these walls in front of me
Someday I'll walk out of here again
Someday I'll walk out of here again


Seems like I've been playing your game way too long
