Everywhere - Fleetwood Mac

Calling out your name
Calling out your name

Can you hear me calling out your name?
You know that I'm falling and I don't know what to say
I'll speak a little louder, I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud and I can't get the words out

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(I wanna be with you everywhere)

Something's happening, happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly
Come along, baby, we better make a start
You better make it soon before you break my heart

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere


Can you hear me calling out your name?
You know that I'm falling and I don't know what to say
Come along, baby, we better make a start
You better make it soon before you break my heart

Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
(I wanna be with you everywhere)
