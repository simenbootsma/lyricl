In Your Arms - Chef'Special

Know you’re gone, I know you’re gone
But I don’t feel what I know
I know you’re gone, I know you’re gone
But my mind ain’t in control
Cause it’s my heart that’s been missing you
And it’s the heart I need to listen to
And it’s been singing songs for tender dreams
The one's you sang to help us sleep
And one day I will sing those songs
Sing them ‘till they sleep
Just like you sang to me
Just like you sang, sang to me

From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms

I miss you so, I miss you so
And I’ll miss you ‘till i’m old
I miss you so, I miss you so
But my fears will fade, I know
‘cause it’s my heart that you helped to build
And love is my compass still yeah
Love will fill the holes I’ve got
‘cause you will never hold me
But I know that you are with me, and I know that you're in peace
Cause you let us sing to sleep

From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe

And i know that you are with me
And i know that you have peace
Cause you let us sing your soul, your mind and heart to sleep

From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe

I miss you so, I miss you so
And I’ll miss you ‘till I’m old
