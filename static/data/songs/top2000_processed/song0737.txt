Overcome - Live
Even now
The world is bleedin'
But feelin' just fine
All numb in our castle
Where we're always free to choose
Never free enough to find
I wish somethin' would break
'Cos we're runnin' out of time
And I am overcome (yeah)
I am overcome
Holy water in my lungs
I am overcome
There's women in the street pullin' out their hair
My master's in the yard
Givin' light to the unaware
This plastic little place
Is just a step amongst the stairs
And I am overcome (yeah)
I am overcome (baby)
Holy water in my lungs (yeah)
I am overcome
So drive me out
Out to that open field
Turn the ignition off
And spin around
Your help is here
But I'm parked in this open space
Blockin' the gates of loveAnd I am overcome (yeah)
I am overcome (baby)
Holy water in my lungs (yeah)
I am overcome (yeah, yeah)
I am overcome (oh Lord)
I am overcome (baby)
Holy water in my lungs (holy water, holy water)
I am overcome
Beautiful drowning
This beautiful drowning
This holy water
This holy water is in my lungs
And I am overcome
I am overcome (yeah, yeah)
I...I...I am overcome
I am overcome
