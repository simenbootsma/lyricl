In Your Eyes  - Peter Gabriel

Love, I get so lost sometimes
Days pass and this emptiness
Fills my heart
When I want to run away
I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go
I come back to the place you are

All my instincts, they return
The grand façade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes, the light, the heat
(In your eyes) I am complete
(In your eyes) I see the doorway
(In your eyes) To a thousand churches
(In your eyes) The resolution
(In your eyes) Of all the fruitless searches
(In your eyes)
(In your eyes) Oh, I see the light and the heat
(In your eyes, the light, the heat)
(In your eyes) Oh, I wanna be that complete
(In your eyes, the light, the heat)
(In your eyes) I wanna touch the light

Love, I don't like to see so much pain
So much wasted and this moment
Keeps slipping away
I get so tired working
So hard for our survival
I look to the time with you
To keep me awake and alive

And all my instincts they return
And the grand façade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes (Your eyes)
(Your eyes) In your eyes
(In your eyes) The light, the heat
(Your eyes) I am complete
(In your eyes) I see the doorway
To a thousand churches
(In your eyes) The resolution
(Your eyes) Of all the fruitless searches
Oh, I see the light and the heat
(In your eyes)
(Your eyes) Oh, I wanna be that complete
(In your eyes)
I wanna touch the light
The heat I see in your eyes
In your eyes
(In your eyes)

Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir
Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir
Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir
Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir
Sa bet chi lamp, chi tangaay, sa bet maangi ci biir
In your eyes (In your eyes, in your eyes)
In your eyes (In your eyes)
In your eyes (In your eyes, in your eyes)
In your eyes (In your eyes)
