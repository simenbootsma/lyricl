Firth Of Fifth - Genesis


The path is clear
Though no eyes can see
The course laid down, long before
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen
Though many times, they've seen the way to leave

He rides majestic
Past homes of men
Who care not or gaze with joy
To see reflected there
The trees, the sky, the lily fair
The scene of death, is lying just below

The mountain cuts off
The town from view
Like a cancer growth
Is removed by skill
Let it be revealed
A waterfall, his madrigal
An inland sea, his symphony
Na-na-na-na-na

Undinal songs
Urge the sailors on
Till lured by the sirens' cry


Now as the river
Dissolves in sea
So Neptune, has claimed another soul
And so with gods and men
The sheep remain inside their pen
Until the shepherd, leads his flock away

The sands of time
Were eroded by
The river, of constant change
