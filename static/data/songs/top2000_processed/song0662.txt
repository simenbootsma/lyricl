Streets - Kensington

So whenever they'll say that all we had is bound to fall
Oh, together we'll stay
(When you get in our way, when you get in our way)
Strange how everything seems to float in grey and drown in gold
Stay and everything's save
(When we're pulling our way, when we're pulling our own way down)

I'll rise and guess where I will go
I'll rise and guess where I'll…

Where do we go when the streets are callin'? (Callin', callin')
How do we know when we reach our fallin'? (Fallin', fallin')

Say that everything caves in on our way to grander goals
Wait, and everything's save
(When we let it all in, when we let it all in)
How, letting it rain, our own distress, our own mistakes
Wait 'till everything breaks
(When we're pulling our way, when we're pulling our own way down)

I'll rise and guess where I will go

Where do we go when the streets are callin'? (Callin', callin')
How do we know when we reach our fallin'? (Fallin', fallin')
Where do we go when the streets are callin'? (Callin', callin')
How do we know when we reach our fallin'? (Fallin', fallin')

I'll rise and guess where I will go
I'll rise and guess where I will…
I'll rise and guess where I will go
I'll rise and guess where I will…

Where do we go when the streets are callin'? (Callin', callin')
How do we know when we reach our fallin'? (Fallin', fallin')
Where do we go when the streets are callin'? (Callin', callin')
How do we know when we reach our fallin'? (Fallin', fallin')
Where do we go when the streets are callin'? (Callin', callin')
How do we know when we reach our fallin'? (Fallin', fallin')
(Fallin', fallin')
