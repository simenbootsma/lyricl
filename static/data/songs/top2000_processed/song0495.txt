Wrong - Novastar
She just left me, oh
And there's no one here that I
Want to change her for
And I was good for her
Still she says she don't know
Who she adores
Where did we go wrong
Was it somewhere along this trip to Miami

Well I don't agree
That you're better off without
Sir Raymond not me
'cause we were good for you
Still you say you don't know
With whom you should be
Where did we go wrong
Was it somewhere along this trip to Miami
Where did we go wrong
Was it somewhere along this trip to Miami
Why should I bother
I don't need no other to be on myself
Why should I bother
I don't need no other, no noSo where did we go wrong
Was it somewhere along this trip to Miami
Where did we go wrong
