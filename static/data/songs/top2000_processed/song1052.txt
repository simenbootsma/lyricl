Liverpool Rain - Racoon

Stuck in a van
As far away as I possibly can
Stuck in a mood
So far away that it couldn't be good
My back hurts and it rains
Screw England, screw the young and insane
We travel in vain
The dreams are the same

So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
I'll stick by you forever and do it in vain
You travel the houses, soothing the pain
Putting a smile on my face once again
So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
Always the rain, oh, the rain

Stuck in a van
And to be honest man
Well, I don't give a damn
I'm stuck in this mood
And to be honest again
Well, it kinda feels good
Now my back hurts and it rains
And it rains and it rains
Screw England, well we'll be young and insane
'Cause it's part of the game
And the dreams are the same

So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
I'll stick by you forever and do it in vain (Oh no, never in vain)
You travel the houses, soothing the pain
Putting a smile on my face once again
So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain, rain, rain

There's a part of me, there's a part of you
There's a history, to follow what to screw
There's a destiny, one for each of you
An obsessiveness that wants to pull us through
Well I've got nothing, a little and a lot
I've got something to share, so much I forgot
Don't know what it means
Oh, the Liverpool I care

So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
I'll stick by you forever, and do it in vain (Oh no, never in vain)
You travel the houses, soothing the pain
Putting a smile on my face once again
So look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain, rain, rain, rain
Yeah, look at the heroes in the Liverpool rain
I'll stick by you forever, didn't do it in vain
You travel the houses, soothing the pain
So look at the hero in the Liverpool rain
The rain (Always the rain)
