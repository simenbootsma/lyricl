Don't Speak - No Doubt

You and me
We used to be together
Every day together, always
I really feel
That I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end

It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real, well, I don't want to know

Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Our memories
They can be inviting

As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands I sit and cry

Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
No, no, no, don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

It's all ending
I gotta stop pretending
Who we are


You and me
I can see us dyin'

Don't speak
I know just what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
No, no, don't speak
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
I know what you're sayin'
So please stop explainin'
Don't speak, don't speak
Don't speak, no
I know what you're thinkin'
And I don't need your reasons
I know you're good
I know you're good
I know you're real good, oh

La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
Don't, don't

Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
Oh, hush, hush, darlin'
Hush, hush, darlin'
