Handle With Care - Traveling Wilburys

Been beat up and battered around
Been sent up
, and I've been shot down
You're the best thing that I've ever found
Handle me with care

Reputation's changeable
Situation's tolerable
But, baby, you're adorable
Handle me with care

I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that you really care?

Everybody's got somebody to lean on
Put your body next to mine, and dream on

I've been fobbed off
, and I've been fooled
I've been robbed and ridiculed
In daycare centers and night schools

Been stuck in airports, terrorized
Sent to meetings, hypnotized
Overexposed, commercialized
Handle me with care

I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that you really care?

Everybody's got somebody to lean on
Put your body next to mine, and dream on

I've been uptight and it made a mess
But I'll clean it up myself, I guess
Oh, the sweet smell of success
Handle me with care
