Save Me - Queen

It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
I love you 'til I die

Save me, save me, save me!
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me!
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
Iâ€™ll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted, all that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside

Save me, save me, save me!
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh!
I'm naked and I'm far from home


Each night, I cry
I still believe the lie
I love you 'til I die (Ow!)

Save me, save me, save me (Oh, yeah!)
(Yeah), Save me (Yeah)
Save me, ooh (Oh, save me!)
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me, oh! (Save me)
I'm naked and I'm far from home
