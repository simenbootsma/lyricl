You - Ten Sharp
It's all right with me
As long as you
Are by my side
Talk or just say nothing
I don't mind your looks never lie
I was always on the run
Finding out what I was looking for
And I was always insecure
Just until I found
Words often don't come easy
I never learned
To show you the inside of me
Oh no my baby
You were always patient
Dragging out what I try to hide
I was always on the run
Finding out what I was looking for
And I was always insecure
Until I found
You, you were always on my mind
You, you're the one I've been living for
You, you're my everlasting fire
You're my always shining starThe night's always a good friend
A glass of wine, and the lights are low
You lying beside me, me full of love
And filled with hope....
