We Don't Need Another Hero - Tina Turner

Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children, the last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome

Looking for something we can rely on
There's got to be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear 'til nothing else remains

All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond

So what do we do with our lives?
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark?
Give it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
The Thunderdome
