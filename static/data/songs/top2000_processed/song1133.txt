Bird Of Paradise - Snowy White
Saw you flying by
Flash of Turquoise Blue
I just had to try
To keep your life in view
My bird of paradise
Sweet bird of paradise
Wish that I could fly
I'd be beside you now
But I can only sigh
And watch you circle round
My bird of paradise
Sweet bird of paradise
My bird of paradise
Sweet bird of paradise
My bird of paradise
So you fly away
When will you come again
So I can watch you play
In the pouring rain
My bird of paradise
Sweet bird of paradise
My bird of paradise
Sweet bird of paradise
My bird of paradise
