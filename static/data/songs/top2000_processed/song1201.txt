How You Gonna See Me Now - Alice Cooper

Dear darlin', surprised to hear from me?
Bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily
Just to let you know I'm gonna be home soon
I'm kinda awkward and afraid time has changed your point of view

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly, babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In, oh, so many ways
How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home?

Listen darlin', now I'm heading for the west
Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess
Yes, I'm worried, honey, guess that's natural though
It's like I'm waiting for a welcome sign like a hobo in the snow

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly, babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In, oh, so many ways
How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man

And just like the first time, we're just strangers again
I might have grown out of style in the place I've been
And just like the first time, I'll be shakin' inside
When I walk in the door, there'll be no place to hide

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly, babe
'Cause I feel I let you down
In, oh, so many ways...
How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly, babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In, oh, so many ways
How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home?

Yeah, yeah
Oh, so many ways
