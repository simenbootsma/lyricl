Radioactive - Imagine Dragons

Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh
Woah

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Woah

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Woah-oh, woah

I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in
Woah

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Woah

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, the sun hasn't died

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Woah-oh, woah
I'm radioactive, radioactive
