You're Still The One - Shania Twain

When I first saw you, I saw love
And the first time you touched me, I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love
Mmm, yeah

Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday

They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together, still goin' strong

(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of

Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'

They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together, still goin' strong

(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
You're still the one

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah

(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life, oh, yeah
(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of

I'm so glad we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
