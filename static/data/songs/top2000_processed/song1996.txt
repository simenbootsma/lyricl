Once Upon A Time In The West - Dire Straits

Some people get a cheap laugh
Breaking up the speed limit
Scaring the pedestrians for a minute
Crossing up progress driving on the grass
Leaving just enough for room to pass
Sunday driver never took a test
Oh yes, once upon a time in the west

Yes and it's no use saying
That you don't know nothing
It's still going to get you if you don't do something
Sitting on a fence that's a dangerous course
Oh, you could even catch a bullet
From the peace-keeping force
Even the hero gets a bullet in the chest
Oh yes, once upon a time in the west



Mother Mary your children are slaughtered
Some of you mothers ought to lock up your daughters
Who's protecting the innocenti
Heap big trouble in the land of plenty
Tell me how we're going to do what's best

Oh yes, once upon a time in the west
Oh yes, once upon a time in the west
Oh yes, once upon a time in the west
Oh yes, once upon a time in the west
