Sad Man's Tongue - Volbeat

Well, my mama told me
"Son you better watch out
All those nasty women
Gonna rip you dime for dime"

But I got my pocket full of real tales
And a broken guitar mode, guitar mode
And the story keep on rollin'
Out from a sad man tongue

Yeah!

Left my mama and papa's nest
I got the rebel fever ramblin' my bones
Papa said "My boy
Take my Johnny Cash vinyl and go"

Well I got my pocket full of real tales
And a broken guitar mode, guitar mode
And the story keep on rollin'

Yeah!

Strollin' down the highway
Said uncle Sam
"You rebel kid now get your ass home
Your ass belong to me
Leave your Johnny Cash song and get home"

I got my pocket full of real tales
And a broken guitar mode, guitar mode
And the story keep on rollin'
Out from a sad man tongue

Singin' in cell 1-40-9-5
No way should I wear guns
I'm sitting my time

Yeah!

Well, left 1-40-9-5
With plenty rock'n'roll songs to play on the road

But I got my pocket full of real tales
And a broken guitar mode, guitar mode
And the story keep on rollin'
Out from a sad man tongue
