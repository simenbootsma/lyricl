Better Days - Dermot Kennedy

Better days are comin', if no one told you
I hate to hear you cryin', over the phone, dear
For seven years runnin', you've been a soldier

But better days are comin'
Better days are comin' for you (Mm-hmm)
So when the night feels like forever (Mm-hmm)
I'll remember what you said to me

I know you've been hurtin'
Waitin' on a train that just won't come
The rain, it ain't permanent
And soon we'll be dancin' in the sun
We'll be dancin' in the sun
And we'll sing your song togеther (Hey-hey, hеy-hey, hey, hey-hey)
And we'll sing your song together (Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey-hey)

We never miss the flowers until the sun's down
You never count the hours until they're runnin' out
You're on the other side of the storm now, you should be so proud

Better days are comin'
Better days are comin' for you (Mm-hmm)
So when the night feels like forever (Mm-hmm)

I know you've been hurtin' (Is our time ever soothin'?
)
Waitin' on a train that just won't come
The rain, it ain't permanent (Is our time ever soothin'?)
And soon we'll be dancin' in the sun
We'll be dancin' in the sun
And we'll sing your song together (Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey-hey)
And we'll sing your song together (Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey-hey)
And we'll sing your song together (Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey-hey)
And we'll sing your song together (Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey-hey)

Your story's gonna change, just wait for better days
You've seen too much of pain, now you don't even know
That your story's gonna change, just wait for better days
I promise you, I won't let go

I know you've been hurtin'
Waitin' on a train that just won't come
The rain, it ain't permanent (Is our time ever soothin'?)
And soon we'll be dancin' in the sun
We'll be dancin' in the sun
And we'll sing your song together (Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey-hey)
And we'll sing your song together (Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey-hey)
And we'll sing your song together (Yeah, we'll sing your song, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey-hey)
And we'll sing your song together (Yeah, we'll sing your song, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey, hey-hey)
